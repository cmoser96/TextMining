aV\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a[Pictures explained at the bottom of the post.]\u000aOver the past year, I have said goodbye to so many individuals--friends--whom I will never see again. In my summer (2011) in Belgium, this semester at the University of Illinois, graduating seniors at Olin, and in the coming three months in Palo Alto for summer 2012. \u000a\u000aI was recently at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign for the Spring 2012 semester. I took this opportunity to experience life at a big public university, a chance that I probably would never get again after I left Olin. Going from a 330+ student school to a 30,000+ student school was a great big change. And it was a wonderful experience. In the end, it made me appreciate my temporary visit there as well as the culture of Olin that I will go back to in the Fall. \u000a\u000a\u000aI came to the U of I very well knowing that if I was to survive -- rather, if I was going to have a meaningful time-- I needed to put myself out there. Illinois is 100x's the size of Olin; no one knows everyone else on campus. No two people have the same agenda for the whole day. Green Street (the 'downtown' of campus) has a Starbucks, a Chipotle, and a Pizza Hut -- seriously, what? This was a mini-city full of macro-minded college individuals. And if I wanted to leave the place in a few months with a refreshed outlook on college (or something like that), I needed to make my 4-month interactions with people usable. Both to them and to me.\u000a\u000aAt Olin, I was a junior who had my group of friends, who had my social 'standing' in the student body, who knew what people expected of me and what I of them. But now, I knew 3 of 40,000 people. I could be whomever I want to be. I could wear a new persona every day and see what happens. This was my opportunity to test my social behaviors on a clean slate. And my approach to finding out more of myself? I observed how I behaved and reacted and engaged with strangers. Could I make my interaction with them usable for both parties?\u000a\u000aThe results to this experiment have been diverse and in some cases, wonderful and bizzare. \u000a\u000a1. In weeks 1-3, I walked up to random people in the Allen Dining hall and sat down to eat dinner with them. It was almost like cold-calling someone, except no a telephone wire to hide behind. One interaction lead to having a penpal to whom I will start writing letters (fancy!).\u000a\u000a2. I met a guy when we both attended a lecture, and we ended up talking for a few minutes about the speaker and what she really meant with all of her lingo. It was a budding friendship, and in the last few weeks of school, I had a once-in-a-lifetime conversation with him. I was the first to hear that he was dropping out of college at U of I to pursue his dreams of pro-basketball in Israel, acting, and singing. Wow, when I think back to how I reacted, it really showed me a lot about who I am. He is at a cross roads in his life now. I told him that if he does end up making it big in life, he better not forget me!\u000a\u000a3. Over the course of the semester, I badly wanted to play some ultimate frisbee especially because it was Springtime. I didn't really know who to contact and where I needed to go to find out more. Three weeks before the end, my first conversation with a friend who was always inebriated when we spoke in the past, revealed that he played ultimate. Over time, I was a little startled to see how similar we were. We both tell your-mom jokes, have similar family backgrounds, and upbringings.\u000a\u000a4. I met a professional English football player who trained with the Arsenal reserves in the past. I met a fellow Arsenal fan that I somehow also contacted via the Photography Club mailing list without even knowing it. I met the upcoming SWE president in my ECE class and gained some insight on the Greek life on campus. I met a SpaceX/Tesla fanatic and we talked about the future of India and electric vehicles. I won a overnight design competition with two guys that I now share a secret handshake with.\u000a\u000aThese are experiences, they are ideas, they are connections and discussions, and they are people that changed and challenged and commended the way I think about me.\u000a\u000a-----\u000a\u000aToday, I go back to Olin to find these special stories hidden in the 330 people I take for granted. Illinois has taught me to have conversations cultivate a spark or a thought or trust or shared ambition. It has shown me that life isn't just the bubble enclosing your College of Engineering. Instead, it is a journey in which you sometimes need to find a chance or take a chance -- make yourself uncomfortable or put your reputation at a bit of risk or challenge someone's wit. It really is these little chances I've taken in my Illinois career that made it worthwhile.\u000a\u000a(The pictures on the top, clockwise from the top-left:Getting ready for an Indian formal with two girls that went to high school in India with me and now study at U of I, Illinois-Michigan Basketball game, congrats graduating seniors!, traditional tea ceremony at the Japan House, Altgeld Tower (we watched them ring the bells up there), South Quad.)\u000a\u000a

aV\u000a        Last week (our much-needed spring break), 14 other Oliners and I road-tripped down to North Carolina to work with a Habitat For Humanity chapter there for a week. For that particular chapter, we were the 3rd of a series of 4 college groups coming down on successive spring break weeks, and they were asking all of them to sign the walls before they were covered - below you can see the Olin O soon to be covered by the siding on the front of the house.\u000a        I've been on this trip twice, and I think they've been my favorite spring breaks. Having even a little bit of experience doing what you are designing for can be invaluable for an engineer, and I think I always pick up a few useful mechanical design ideas from working on the houses. Also, we get to use power tools and hammers, which means on the technical side, I'm pretty happy pretty quickly.\u000a\u000aAnother thing I enjoy about the Habitat trips is the chance to hang out with a set of Oliners I might not otherwise, without the pressure of school and project work. It's a cliche, but "the people" has consistently been my favorite thing about Olin, and I absolutely love the chance to hear people talk about what they're passionate about, to argue the big questions, to make stupid jokes and play surprisingly intense card games all evening.\u000aWe also found a lot of these bear statues. Look, over bear!\u000a\u000aGrateful to have missed one more (hopefully the last of the spring?) snowstorm in Massachusetts, we stopped at the beach on the drive home. It was chillingly "refreshing", but there were dolphins swimming very close to us.\u000aI hope your spring break was likewise refreshing, relaxing and recreative! We're into the final push of the year now!\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aI was going to post about the scavenger hunt this past weekend, but with everything that's going on, I feel like I should perhaps go to a more solemn topic.\u000aToday was the Day of Silence. I was one of the students who participated- before today I never had. Basically, the Day of Silence is about recognizing and honoring all of the queer individuals who have to remain silent about their orientation, etc. Open, one of the bigger clubs at Olin, organized everything, from screening armbands to setting up a "breaking the silence" ceremony. The armbands indicated one of two levels of participation: participant (someone who actually would not talk all day) and supporter (someone who could talk, but still wanted to show that their hearts were with people). I was a participant.\u000aIt was a sad day already, with a ceremony for VT in the morning, but not talking definitely kept me more solemn than usual. It was a strange feeling not to be able to talk for so long, and it certainly made things difficult. I ended up eating lunch by myself, just to avoid the awkwardness that came with a one-sided conversation. The discomfort was worth it, though. The ceremony, the general support, and the camaraderie that came along made me realize just how good a network can be, and I'm glad that I can be supportive of people I know who had to deal with being silent. I may not identify as being queer, but I'm glad I went to a queer-friendly school.\u000a

aV\u000aLast Wednesday we had elections for our community service group here at Olin- Supporting Encouraging and Recognizing Volunteerism.   This group is responsible for exactly what it sounds like- working to help promote community service.  Since we have community service hours here every week from 3-5pm on Friday, it's great to have service opportunities here on campus.\u000a Oh wait- getting back on point- I'm going to be the Manager of Finance and Records for SERV next year.  I'm really excited, because right now I'm planning a lighter course load, so I'll be able to get really involved with planning service activities for campus.  I want to try to lower barriers of entry to people performing service by having more opportunities on campus, and also by helping schedule service at times when Olin students are free.\u000a The Manager of Finance and Records is also responsible for several other things.  First of all, taking minutes at weekly SERV meetings so ideas are recorded.  The MFR also keeps track of all reimbursements and funding for service.  Finally, and somewhat importantly, the MFR is responsible for being the SERV liason to CORe.\u000a I'm particularly excited about this because it gives me a chance to try to spread SERV even further.  Since CORe is supposed to be the liason between students-faculty-staff I'm hoping to get everyone involved in a big project this coming year.  The interaction with CORe was actually how I became interested in the position.  I was on CORe this year, and I was sad at not being on E-Board, and upon investigation the SERV MFR seemed to be the ideal role.  I care about serving people off campus, and about Olin, and this is a good connection between the two.\u000a So, potential-future-Olin-students (or current Olin Students), let me know: what cool service things do you do? What types of service would you like to see on campus?\u000a----\u000aChange of thoughts.  This past weekend I went to NYC to visit my Grandma and Aunt.  While I was there I saw three plays: the Coast of Utopia trilogy by Tom Stoppard.  If you get a chance to see these plays, or any Stoppard, they were amazing.  I highly recommend it.  The plot centers around the Russian Revolution and the events around the time the serfs were freed.  I also got to see the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  I really liked the chance to get to be away from everything here for a bit.  As much fun as Olin is, it can be a bit overwhelming at times.\u000a

aV\u000aNote: This post is a fortnight overdue 'cause its author was lazy getting relevant images. This should dispel any myths about an Olin time travel project, as the author promises that had he the means the travel back in time and post it on Halloween, he would have.\u000aThis Halloween, I walked through the dining hall en route to a sandwich and couldn't help smirking at one of the Jack O'Lanterns sitting along the hallway. Being a new arrival and not brainwashed by Olin culture, I immediately stopped and thought to myself "How strange." and "Why would anyone at Olin be afraid of this?"\u000a\u000aOhh, scary!\u000a\u000aI call it the PI-umpkin (after the control system it models) and find it an excellent segue to a common piece of Olin knowledge and non-obvious qualities of the Olin community. Simulink is responsible for the strange shapes carved on the pumpkin, and my fellow first years and I find ourselves spending a lot of quality time with Simulink. Simulink is a math modeling program from The MathWorks. Simulink can model PI control (the pumpkin); Simulink can model the "detumbling" and sun alignment of the Cloud CubeSat (very nifty Olin-Nasa Research Group Project); Simulink could probably model and control the drying of your laundry.Perhaps the coolest thing Simulink can do is allow you to create differential equations just by piecing together several "blocks" (for example, the sideways triangles above, gain blocks) in a way that represents measurable values of the system and the relationship between these values.So what does the PI-umpkin say about Olin? It says that Oliners take a lot of the same classes (and with 300 students, we have to). It says that Oliners blur lines between work and play, between class and social. And perhaps best of all, the PI-umpkin shows that we are proud of Olin and--in the greatest spirit of satire--like to make fun of ourselves.\u000aI mean, really, how many colleges do you know of with students who regularly wear shirts like this:\u000a\u000aor this\u000a\u000a?\u000aColin\u000a

aV\u000aOnce upon a time I was sitting in an airport at 5:30 AM with two of my best friends (here's a picture of us at the airport). I wrote this beautiful post about Olin friendships, but then a funny thing happened- actually, a thing that seems to happen to anyone with a senior laptop. My hard drive died. Needless to say, I'm still sad about this, so this is my feeble attempt at rewriting that beautiful post about Olin friendships (Trust me, it was gorgeous).\u000aOver break, I spent a lot of time with my family. I'm not going to lie, I had a rough last semester. But that's beside the point. I would not have made it to this one without the love and support of the Olin community. My family knew this, and we spent a lot of the break chatting about the past semester and the many things my friends did for me.\u000aMy dad made an interesting observation. He told me that when he listens to me talk about my friends at Olin, I do it in a way that he never did about his friends from college. He says that my face lights up when I mention their names, that I sound genuinely happy with the people I've surrounded myself with, and I tell stories as if I've known them forever (granted, it's been four years, which is almost forever, right?). I'm invested in the people I've met here, and he's so happy that I have found the friends I've made.\u000aI spent a lot of time over break thinking about what he said, and realized he was right. I cannot imagine going through Olin and not forming these friendships. All those late nights working, playing, laughing, crying. Setting off fire alarms, working with an excessive amount of sticky notes, making mac and cheese with peas, pulling pranks, surprising people at midnight for their birthdays... We've done it all, and somehow, together, we've made it to the last semester. Sure, there are times when we all complain about the smallness of Olin, but the size has led to some indescribable friendships.\u000aIf any of you are reading this (yes, you should know who you are), know that you've made my Olin experience incredibly amazing. I cannot imagine any of my experiences without any of you, and I am so grateful to have you around. \u000aTo all of you who've been invited to candidate's weekend: get ready. The people you will meet at Olin will change your life. You may even end up with some best friends out of that one magical weekend.

aV\u000aYesterday, 30-some young people like me were killed. They study what I study, do the things I do- rush from class to rehearsal to class to speech to meal to work to friends to sleep. People with hopes and dreams and interests, brilliant curious people, just college kids like me. Students with their own nerdy jokes and analytical discussions like mine, with ideas just as big, just as small. Young adults just as consumed in their storm of clubs, projects, assignments. People just as stressed about their over-stuffed to-do list for the next week, just as focused on passing their next exam, and just as thrilled by the painting they experienced over the weekend or the song they just heard. Creatures just as relieved to put down problem sets to sing or play or dance. People sighing like me as they put their head down into the 3rd day of rain and the hard start of another week's work, highs and lows. More than 30 people just like me were killed yesterday. Killed by another just like us.\u000aI'm sure details of all levels will come out to satisfy our horrified curiosity. I wonder if they can answer the shocked questions we, the public, or we, the nation's students might ask. They're the same questions we've asked before. Could it happen to me? What would such horror do to me? Or a loved one? What does it mean when young people gun down their peers? Why does it happen again and again? Are we still shocked, or does repetition approach normalness? What is it about the way we live that twists and grinds people to do this? Are security or surveillance acceptable solutions? How does this tragedy shape our vision of the futue? How do we go on? And where are we going on to?\u000aI have no answers. I am sorry for everyone that felt this happen.\u000a

aV\u000aAll the world's a stage, and all the engineers and actors merely players\u000aHi all, my name is Casey and I am currently a junior studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at Olin College of Engineering in Needham, Massachusetts, USA. This fall semester I am studying theatre and performance abroad at Goldsmiths in London, UK!\u000aThis blog post and the few I write this upcoming semester will focus on how my Olin education impacts my theatre performance or adventures in London!\u000aIt was the first day of school here and I was doing a butterfly stretch in one of my acting intensives. Our professor asked us to share our name, our major, our school, and why we are here. This was meant to be a social warmup. I told them my backstory that when I was in high school, I was confident I was going to study performing arts in college. My sophomore year of high school, I enrolled in a computer science course to fill my schedule. Surprisingly, I was so intrigued! The labs were...actually really fun. Everything I thought I wanted--the stage, the acting, the dancing, the storytelling--was now in question. Under some encouragement, I applied to a handful of engineering colleges but most of them were too boringly rigid for my taste. Then I experienced Candidates Weekend at Olin. Candidates Weekend can best be described as a huge bundle of energy emanating from everyone and everything in the space, and this energy carried me and my fellow candidates to complete the task of designing a solution to a proposed challenge. The experience was electrifyingly awesome; not only did they blast all of my favorite songs while we worked, but I felt like my creativity and imagination were in full swing and in full demand to design a solution! I chose Olin because I felt that, at Olin, I could take my creativity from the stage to the classroom. My homework included real people problems! Plus, engineering is pretty awesome!\u000aThe professor eyed me incredulously. It was weird to her that an engineer wanted to study theatre. She probably thought I was having a quarter-life crisis. My thoughts are that engineers are creative beings, especially the ones hanging around Olin. Theyre definitely some of the wackiest, funniest, wittiest people I know! They are also definitely weird, awkward, and order Dominos every night or Thai food (free delivery from Lemon Thai!), but we invent, innovate, and design ideas and solutions. Surely, engineers and actors are equally creative, right?\u000aFraming is one of the most applicable lessons that I have learned. Thank you, Ben Linder! Ben Linder is the professor for Design Nature, a first year class at Olin. I hope Im not spoiling anything by saying that one day in class he challenged us to individually scribble on a post-it note as many birds as we could think of in 1 minute. I recorded 20, maybe? Post exercise, the students shared their count of total birds. Most of us had around 20-30. Then Ben Linder asked Debbie Chandra, another instructor who participated and swore she did not know the topic beforehand, to share her bird count and she had around 80! AROUND EIGHTY! In his lecture, he revealed that the secret to listing as many birds as possible was FRAMING. Instead of asking yourself to list out all the birds you know, you should frame the problem to maximize bird count. You think about all the places where you might see birds. Then go through each location and write down the birds you see at each location. Instead of focusing on writing down all the birds you can think of at once, frame the problem into categories. Framing is actually the design technique I use to acquire more ideas for my improv scenes or when I'm stuck, I try looking at things from a new angle.\u000aNew angles quite literally, actually. We were instructed to move, but keep one or two points of contact with the floor at all times, the goal was to see how many funky positions we could twist our bodies into. Using the heel of my foot and the palm of my hand as my points of contact, I was in mid lunge. So focused on balancing to think about other points of contact, I fell hard and loud on my thigh. My instructor came over with I loved what you were doing with your body and you can go so many places from there. She placed herself in my position; balancing so much better than I did, and showed me the flexibility I had in that position. She effortlessly transitioned into 5 more positions and left me with the task of finding more. She comfortingly said Sorry you fell. The floor is the best partner an actor can have, though, for it is unrelentlessly hard. I had never before thought of the floor as my partner. While in that position, I thought I had exhausted the different positions I could make holding myself up with my palm and my heel. Since I was blank on inspiration, I started pulling inspiration from water, art, my social media etc. For example, asking myself if someone poured water on top of my head, how could I guide it down with my body, like a water slide? I was willing to push through, let me body guide me, and at every creative road block, frame the problem a little differently. And guess what? I only fell once more that class period!\u000aAdditionally, when it feels like improv games are going on forever, I think about what Im not thinking about, about my Facebook news feed, about my cooking experience, about any films or anything Ive seen recently. Usually, then I can form an idea for a scene. With improv and with other things, you dont have to plan out the entire scene. You can have an initial idea and just go with it to see what comes out! I feel like this was an important lecture for me. Just letting go and instinctively reacting with my body and my words. Because acting is about reacting!\u000aOlin taught me how to frame problems and my theatre classes here have allowed me to practice framing scenes and iterate on my skills quickly. According to American Scientific, new studies show that there is so no such thing as left brain and right brain creativity. Instead, during the entire creative process, the different creative sub processes that occur during the entire creative process ask different brain regions for help when they need it. I dont know neuroscience well, but I am choosing to believe that the creative process for both an engineer and an actor use the same brain regions. Actors and engineers will have a different framing and different outcomes, but the creativity exercises for theatre students also work for engineering student sections. As a brilliant man once said all the world's a stage and actors and engineers both require the same creative muscles to play their roles and help people in their own way.\u000aHere are some pictures of me at famous places for entertainment! Cheers from London!\u000a\u000a\u000a

aV\u000a        Many months ago, over the course of my first weeks at Olin, I had a vision of a spectacular future. It was not the end of the term, when I would hopefully regard my first semester of university with satisfaction, nor was it my summer break, when I would finally be back with my friends and working irregular, long hours (a useful talent I'm now proud to have perfected here at Olin). Instead, I was picturing a full year hence, when a new flock of freshmen would populate the campus.\u000aIn my first months, I loved learning all of the quirks that make\u000athe people at Olin so unique and engaging. I loved the fact that, from\u000aa healthy competitive spirit in all fields pool-, ping-pong-, and table\u000asoccer-related * to lavish hallway birthday decorations, a given\u000aactivity is nurtured by a hugely supportive cast of classmates and\u000afriends. It was natural for me to jump on board supporting this and\u000aevery endeavor. I provided muscle to movers, brainpower to innovators,\u000aand inspiration to others with (for instance) my recent roast of Tim\u000aRyan (class of 2013), and countless irregular hair and beard\u000aconfigurations over the course of my time here (which happened to\u000aaugment the confusion some have superficially differentiating me and my\u000atwin brother).\u000aI foresaw enjoying a whole new class taking part\u000ain this excitement, shaking things up in ways we old fogies would no\u000alonger imagine. When I saw our present upperclassmen regarding our\u000afrivolities with benevolence, I breathlessly anticipated taking their\u000aplace, partaking in that all-encompassing wisdom. I believe the next\u000aclass will be like ours, but better, and the difference is that my\u000aclass will be there to help guide and direct the next one!\u000aSo,\u000aas I go through the routines and trials that have faced me throughout\u000athe year, I've made mental notes to myself to remember our solutions\u000aand our stumbling blocks, so as to transmit them to the coming\u000aclass(es). I've been brushing up on my Olin lore for my own\u000aedification, but also to share it. (Since arriving at Olin, I've become\u000aparticularly interested in a more open and intuitive transfer of\u000ainformation between the classes, not because my experience was lacking,\u000abut\u000abecause I recognize the impetus to reinvent and improve all systems\u000athat is part of the school's honour code: 'openness to change').\u000aThis\u000a'mission' has been on my mind as of late, coupled with the knowledge\u000athat the class of 2014 is out there, dispersed throughout all the\u000amarvelous candidates I will meet in the coming weekends. Actually, I\u000awas going to write this entry about how three CWs will be worlds different from having two, but I suppose that will have to wait until my next (imminent!) post.\u000aGood luck to all and happy countdowns!Graham \u000a*\u000aZach, a current Sophomore, and I are presently engaged in a\u000acompanionable 'best of five best of five' wherein I won three games of\u000aboth ping pong and chess to his two, and lost resoundingly in a game of\u000a'Curses' (a very entertaining interactive card game) and a limbo\u000acompetition. We are loathe to finish the final round, lest we unleash a\u000a'best of five best of five best of five' challenge. In the future, you\u000amay find us locked in eternal struggle, neither one definitively better\u000athan the other in all disciplines, both incapable of marking a victory\u000aacross the board.\u000a

aV\u000aIt occurred to me recently that most of the Olinsider posts are probably written when people find themselves less busy than usual - although they're often about the things that made them busy at other times. So, in the interest of trying something different/giving a "snapshot" of Olin life, here's just a brief post to say I'm currently sitting in the lounge with about half of my dynamics class arguing with tomorrow's problem set. \u000aPeople keep bringing us pity food.\u000aDynamics is one of the hardcore technical course in the mechanical engineering program (I'm defining this set as Thermodynamics, Mechanics of Solids and Structures, Transport Phenomena, and Dynamics). In general, I've found this group of classes most time-intensive and conceptually challenging - but by now I have a better handle at least on how to approach these classes. Briefly, my plan is:\u000a1) Go to office hours all the time. I even have them on my outlook calendar, just like classes. 2) Ask for help early and often. I figure if I completely humiliate myself with stupid questions, I can always move far, far away after graduation and never see anyone in the class again, but at least I'll know dynamics*3) Don't finish every problem set. If not sleeping tonight will mean you can't follow the material presented in class tomorrow, it's not worth it.**\u000a*Or, y'know, just ask the questions and figure no one's paying attention to who asked them.** Speaking of which, I'm going to bed.\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aHi! \u000aIt's summer in Boston, with plenty of sunshine, and the semester is officially finished today with the end of Olin Exposition (Expo)! The next event on my outlook calender has been "GO HOME", a whole day event planned for tomorrow. Finals were done last Thursday, and most people stayeda bit longer for Expo today.\u000a\u000aDark Chocolate Blueberry Pralines\u000aTo end my passionate pursuit in Chocolate making, I made some blueberry pralines and chocolate mousse with macaroon cake today.. Although I didn't make them in time to present at Expo, I listened to the fantastic Olin quartet play Shostokovich's no.8 string quartet during my supposed presentation time instead.They played so professionally, that combined with the scenery from the dance studio on third floor Academic Center, is an experience quite out of this world.\u000a\u000aOlin String Quartet playing at Expo\u000aI feel very proud to be an Olin student, seeing all the cool things presented at Expo to the community and visitors. My favorite projects were the Ski Winch:\u000a"In true adventuring style, we built a winch to aid in easing the boredom and\u000amonotony of winter days. Able to pull us across the snow quickly with a cute6.5 hp motor, it produces endless fun for any day you don't want to dohomework."\u000aIt deserves the "Best at playing" award. The other one is a rocket engine that my fellow freshman classmates built that uses acrylic tube as fuel and produces a cute orange flame.\u000aWhat I like about Olin the most is that everyone is excited about building and engineering, just as I am, and I can learn a lot from upperclassman who are very willing to teach us.. It's quite impossible to get bored here, even when classes have ended.For example, last friday was Build Day, and I welded my first parts under the instructions of Janie, a graduating senior. The bright green light that the melted metal producedis very cool to look at. Everyone can get trained with the machine shop equipments (Mill, Lathe, Welding stations.. etc). The procedure just involves reading,taking a quiz, doing a training session with Peter, our super friendly machine shop guy,and making a test piece.\u000aAs fun as Olin has been, it's time to say hello to the world outside and summer! I will be doing an internship at Dassault Systems in Waltham (30 mins away from here), and I'm super excited to learn to fly a plane in the summer!\u000aHope you all enjoy summer :)\u000aJudy\u000a

aV\u000aI hope, gentle reader, that after such a long absence, you will find it in yourself to think me not too remiss for my undiligence. Allow me, if you will, a moment's update on the goings on of the past few months that have taken me mindfully away from things Olin. I assure you that, passing now back into a state of returning, thoughts of school, courses, beginnings, reunions and fresh meetings, I have returned to that which I had forgotten, my life at Olin and this blog, its journal. So please, step back in with me with summer eyes at the many busy doings of a summer in Somerville, and we will together make ready a renewed dialogue twixt me, word-smitten writer, and you, a friend ushered welcoming back home.\u000aTopics for discussion: Foundry summer E!, Boston summer living, New England summer concert binge, quite a fall to come.\u000aMy employer for this summer has been myself. As mentioned in The Foundry Isn't for Forging Steel, I have been involved with an entrepreneurial undertaking in the clean energy realm. This summer, I took advantage of the Foundry's summer E! program and continued to work on the project through the summer months. This means that I maintain a sweet office in the Foundry, and have prime facilities at which to research, study, scheme, prep, pitch, and generally explore the direction of a concept. I've had the opportunity to pitch to panels of business professionals, discuss business logistics with corporate lawyers,  chat with franchise owners and managers, and implement a research project with Olin faculty. Starting to meet key players in the Boston clean energy industry has been one of the most fascinating parts of this experience. There are a lot of very smart, very driven people looking hard at the twin opportunity and dilemma of the need for clean energy, and these minds form across government, industry, and business are trying to make Boston a hotbed for clean technology innovation. More on this strengthening surge of clean tech E! another time.\u000aMy presence at the Foundry also means being a part of the community there, as several of the businesses have members dedicating their summers to pushing forward on their projects. We give each other weekly updates on our progress, in order to share ideas and give advice based on our own experiences. Advisers also make appearances at this weekly meeting to give expert opinions on our doings. The teams at work this summer include- Xobl, the Automated Tuberculosis Diagnostic, Bluestem Energy, an exciting home coffee roasting accessory, Recipe Tango, Idea Tree Design. I am also vaguely aware that the efforts of Sonicfoam continue, although that company does not work with us here in Needham. We've even done some improvements on our physical space, which will continue to grow with the program. See below for my contribution.\u000a\u000aFresh carpentry in the new public design space for student businesses @ the Foundry. Automated TB Diagnostic team manager Jessie Lin not included. Note the "Soft focus" for artistic effect.\u000aBesides the Foundry goings on, it has been well worth the effort to live off campus for the summer. As idyllic as the Ivory Tower of Olin is, having a separate living space in the bustle and variety of the neighborhood of Tufts University has been excellent. It really takes genuine on-foot exploration to get a feel for a city, and living within walking distance of the T (here in Davis Square) is a big difference from living within driving distance of the T (at Olin).\u000aI've also taken full liberty to spend all the money I'm not earning at the Foundry to buy concert tickets. From NYC to the Fenway neighborhood to Portland, Maine, I have found myself in striking distance of many a good show. Dispatch: Zimbabwe (slamming reunion for charity), Less Than Jake and Reel Big Fish (killer ska ruckus from 2 of the masters [MASTERS!] of the art), The Cat Empire (best dancing time at a live show a kid could have), and State Radio (another solid reggae rock jam fest.) Perhaps later I'll wax artistic in full music critic style about these shows. Do the readers feel this to be Olin relevant?\u000aAs my mind starts to turn back to the homelike halls of shimmering Olin, my anticipation grows at all the fresh life and activity to come. A fresh suite of friends, a full complement of new courses, and a host of other goings on... it promises to be quite the fall. I promise more before I see you there -\u000abc\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aI'm still struggling with managing my time. It's funny because from last semester to this one, I went from dancing five times a week to approximately zero times, and from 16 math/engineering credits to 18 credits, only 8 of which are engineering (the other 10 are arts/humanities/social sciences--AHS for short--and design). So theoretically I should have more free time and a variety of work to interest me. But I still feel as if I'm busy all the time, and it's hard to focus on work. There are all kinds of other things going on! How can I resist? The thing is: high school and college are completely different experiences. I feel that I'm trapped in the high school mindset of paying attention in class and thinking that that will be enough, but it's not. I need to put in more hours outside of class to master the material and complete the work. Dorm life can't be all fun and games (although it may appear that way sometimes).\u000a        \u000aI think that the secret lies in habits. Habits in actions as well as in thoughts. If I can change the way I habitually hit the snooze button in the morning, I'll get an earlier start to the day. If I can change the way I habitually assume that weekends mean no work, I'll spread out the work over a longer period of time. I know I'm being vague by simply saying 'work'; that's because it could as easily mean a problem set as a group design exercise or an hour of DJing practice (for an Independent Study).\u000aI'm writing about this instead of Wintry Mixer or The Vagina Monologues or the hooping workshop, all of which were fun, because it's an issue that's been bothering me since the beginning of college. It's also something that you have to figure out at some point--how to change your behaviors to fit a different environment, or simply how to manage time more effectively. As a sidenote, I've never liked that expression, "managing time," because time doesn't seem like something you can really manage. 'To direct' or 'to exert control over' are two of the more common definitions I found when I looked up the word (manage). I think the expression should be changed to "self-management with respect to time." Unfortunately, it's more cumbersome to say.\u000aThis week is incredibly busy, but I look forward to it as a chance to change a few habits, work on some more problem sets and design exercises, and have some fun.\u000aWish me luck,\u000aShannon\u000aP.S. I had a wonderful Valentine's Day! Thank you!\u000a

aV\u000aLet's face it.  Sitting in front of a computer all day can be mind-numbingly boring.  Unfortunately, that's how I spent my summer job at Lincoln Laboratory.  Don't get me wrong, the work was quite interesting.  But it's really difficult for me to keep focus sometimes when the sun is shining outside.\u000aSo I was more than happy to visit another national laboratory where work has just a little more blue sky involved.\u000a\u000a    \u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aWelcome to the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) in Boulder/Golden, Colorado.\u000aMy friend Heena (a fellow rising senior at Olin) spent her summer here, working for the National Wind Technology Center.  She studied the dynamics and natural modes of turbines.  But more importantly, she got to get outside and actually climb up these things!\u000aLuckily, during my visit she took me along to the top of a turbine.\u000a\u000a    \u000a\u000a\u000aWhen Heena originally told me we'd be climbing up to the top, I thought we'd be on a ladder the whole way.  Turns out even hardcore MechEs get lazy (they sometimes need to go up and down more than 10 times in a single day), so NREL built an elevator inside the turbine that takes you most of the way up.  But you do need a ladder for the last 15 feet or so.\u000aHere's a shot of Heena showing off the inside of the turbine.\u000a\u000a    \u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aBut the coolest part was the view from the top.\u000a\u000a    \u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aIn the background you can see the foothills of the Rockies that border the Denver/Boulder area to the West.  The narrow canyon you see as you follow the line of the turbine nose directly outward is Eldorado Canyon.   This natural funnel makes the NREL wind site an ideal location for harvesting energy from high speed winds.  It's also insanely scenic, especially if you're looking through rock star protective goggles like I was.\u000aOverall NREL seems like an awesome place to spend a summer (though Heena tells me she definitely did her share of indoors computer work).  And it taught me one of the biggest lessons of my summer: that I might be just a little bit happier if I can find a job that puts me closer to  blue sky and the wild outdoors.\u000a

aV\u000a        Yep - it's that time of year again: Expo guests have come and gone; the shops and stockrooms have been straightened; and requests for rides to the airport rise exponentially. Projects pass through crunch time and wrap up - we hope. Figure: I tracked the hours I was spending on my most project-based class over the course of the semester. The red reference line is the nominal 12 hours/week an average 4-credit course is supposed to take. Don't worry, not all projects do this...\u000a\u000a        Suitcases, piles to-be-packed and offers of free stuff fill in the hallways. Why does packing always require things getting so messy before the room gets clean?The commencement tent is up, and the forecast for graduation day looks promising.\u000aAs a senior, there's something special and slightly surreal about this last run through the end of the last year at Olin... Four years has managed to be very long, and very short indeed. Sometimes, I'm amazed at just how much I've learned and done in the last 4 years, but more often, I'm struck by just how much I didn't - how many fields I've just scratched the surface of, how much more there is to learn. \u000aI owe many thanks for these 4 years: to the faculty and staff at Olin, to the trustees and administration (and to the Olin Foundation for starting this crazy adventure in the first place!), to the older classes of Oliners who "left Olin better than they found it" - I hope we lived up to your example, and I know we now leave it in good hands - and of course, to my compatriots, the Class of 2013.\u000aRight. Enough vague senior ramblings. It's been a pleasure to share my experiences in the last few years here - thanks for joining me!\u000a-Caroline\u000aPS: Since it's the question everyone's asking: I am still waiting to hear back about a post-graduation opportunity I am very excited about.

aV\u000aOne month of French immersion, and I'm starting to toughen up. I mean, I thought I was pretty tough after my first semester at Olin, when I was swimming harder than I ever had to in high school to keep my head above academic water.  I thought I was pretty tough when the physics and calculus and circuits and design and technical presentations and team scheduling all started to click during the second semester. The heat turned up along with my expectations for myself during sophomore year, when I took on a business project in addition to course work. It took some serious work to keep the fires burning and the grades high. Maybe "tough" felt more like "numb" during this past fall, when I took 4 courses, audited another, and wrote an extra half-course's worth of research paper. Especially during the weeks of Mid-terms and Finals: It was tough.\u000a\u000aBehind this door: Reflections on language immersion.\u000a        \u000aBut now I'm in France, and it's a whole new rugby game, as it were. This past month, I would go to sleep just as exhausted as during some of the crazier Olin weeks, even before my classes at the University of Nantes had really begun. The reason is easy to name: language immersion is tough. Sometimes it takes some real mental and emotional toughness to face day after day of linguistic exercise.  It takes some real courage to speak up in class, to French students in my weekly Capoeira class, to the admin staff at my program trying to nail down my course schedule, to my (very talkative) host family. The mix of feelings throughout a day, the struggle and success back to back, is complex to be sure. What I'm finding is really just what I'd hoped to find: Studying and living in French is a whole new flavor of challenge, and it's every bit as delicious as the college life back in the States.\u000aOne of the tricks I've tried to employ to keep my French improving and my spirits high is to enjoy the mistake. Its pretty obvious that an American student, even after 8 years of classroom French study, is gonna be pretty far from a native speaker. So making mistakes isn't just inevitable, it seems to be exactly the way to improve. Maybe if I make every mistake in the French language enough times, the same part of my brain that memorizes theater scripts or movie lines will gradually accrue more and more expertise, and I'll wake up the second week of May chattering like my jeune Nantais comrades of 21 years. It's certainly awkward sometimes, and more than a little frustrating when you can't find the words, or worse, you find the words but your pronunciation is incomprehensible. But I think if you can enjoy the mistake, you'll never be disappointed. A wise friend once told me the same thing about romance, but that's for another blog.\u000a\u000aLights dancing in my eyes, hopefully after some linguistic revelation.\u000a\u000aHere's a good example of a mind bending language experience from this past week. I'm taking two courses at the University of Nantes, one of which is very engineering style. It's essentially a statics course, the mechanics of structures, here found in the physics department, though at Olin we color this subject Engineering. This week we had our first TD, or Travail Dirige, or Guided Work session. Generally, in the CM, or Cours Magistral, or lecture, one can pretty much sit back and absorb. Listening comprehension sky-rockets pretty quickly after arrival, I've found. But in the TD, we were finally asked to produce something for the first time. The content wasn't mind blowing- the questions for this TD were essentially asking us to balance the forces and moments on a simple structure to calculate the tensor which describes the internal efforts. But the time lag between interpreting the vocabulary, along with the technical terminology that was fresh for the whole class, and then figuring out to how to organize variables and apply the concepts... it turned out to be a significant lag.\u000aThere's one other American in my class, a student in the same study abroad program who hails from Virginia Tech. She had the additional perspective of having solved very similar problems before, and was finding that the French prof's approach was somewhat conceptually different. There were some long moments of staring at my page and its diagram of a strange looking apparatus labeled with some words that apparently never came up when we were discussing vocab around the house or at a restaurant back in my high school French classes. There was also at least one occasion when the prof would come over, notice I had done little more than copy the symbols (including French subscripts and references), and offer a jolt of advice that flew just shy of comprehension, leaving me nodding in wishful thinking but not making progress.\u000aThings started to improve most drastically after a couple important changes- primarily, starting to ask questions. Not having the courage to speak up (in somewhat broken French) and start giving form to my roadblocks was proving devastating. Once we started to have an exchange between the prof and me, between my classmates and me, and between my American comrade and me, we started to find the common technical language that let us describe both what we were looking at and what we were trying to do with it. All of a sudden, I realized I was staring at a drill press-like device, and that I had chosen the theoretical description of the internal efforts that required the longest calculation. But I was on the way, which at the time I crafted into a perhaps novel French expression "sur le chemin," which got the idea across that I was getting somewhere.\u000a\u000aFigure 1: The "Forgot To Bring My French/English Dictionary to Physics Class" Apparatus\u000aClass time was over by this point, but rather than being saved by the bell I lingered to talk with the prof a bit. Maybe I was trying to reassure both him and me that I had now somewhat gotten a clue, that, yes, I would finish the rest of the TD on my own (French profs collect nothing besides the Final, and maybe a midterm, anyway), and remark on how all the cultural references used to describe abstract concepts don't translate so easily. There's a good solid dozen of mistakes checked off my list. When my head stops spinning, I'll come back for the remaining thousands.\u000a\u000aFrench Tourism Photo of the Week: Mont St. Michel seen from across the misty fields of Normandy.\u000aRegards from Nantes-\u000aBennett\u000a

aV\u000aCiao!\u000aI'd been trying to think of a good way to relate my study away experience to Olin, which seemed difficult to do at first with blog entries - I'm not at Olin right now, after all.  I finally came up with the answer, though, when I was talking to a friend recently about homesickness and cravings.  Thus, this post will be an abbreviated listing of the things that I do and do not miss about Olin.\u000a\u000a\u000aFigure 1: One thing I miss about Olin (left to right: Andrea, me, Vivian, and Lyndsey, all members of Olin's class of 2009).\u000a\u000a\u000aFigure 2: One thing Olin cannot provide (taken inside the Colosseum; the cross is located in front of what was once the emperor's booth).\u000a        \u000aWhat I miss about Olin\u000a1. My friends.\u000aOlin is home to the most fun, interesting, and intelligent people I have ever known.  I feel slightly cheesy writing this, but it's definitely true.  I've met some interesting people here, especially in my various travels, but nothing really challenges the diversity, intensity, and hilarity of my Olin friends.\u000a2. Living in an absurdly safe place.\u000aAt Olin, venturing out alone at night can hardly be considered dangerous.  There's no need to constantly cling to one's valuables or bury money in the depths of one's pockets.  There are rarely any strangers (especially at night), much less ones who blow in your ear, shout obscenities at you, or expose themselves to you (all of these things have happened to me and/or my friends since arriving in Rome).\u000aIf one chooses to go to a party, not only will it be within a few floors of one's room (or perhaps the next dorm over), thus making a taxi or public transportation unnecessary, but it also will be filled with friendly, chatting, trustworthy people.  Additionally, one's friends (and trained R2s) will make sure one is safe, healthy, and looked after, no matter what.\u000a3. THAI FOOD.\u000aWe all know of my addiction.  Rome, however, is unaware of it and/or unwilling to enable me.\u000a4. The internet.\u000aMy Roman apartment has a router. Currently, 11 people use it (me, my 4 roommates, and the 6 guys next door). When everybody else is asleep, our roughly 50 mbps connection is fine. When everybody is awake, 50 mbps might as well be 0. Additionally, the router is too far from my bedroom, so I have to sit in the kitchen if I want to check my e-mail. AND I paid 80 euros for it - roughly $120 - as did all 10 other users and my sixth roommate (who went home after 10 days - studying away wasn't her thing, evidently). 12 times $120 divided by 4 months... Fume.\u000aAt Olin, I've never had a problem with the internet being too slow. Ever. I also routinely e-mail people while lying in bed. I can even sit out on the lawn and check my e-mail - on warm, sunny days, of course. It's lovely.\u000a5. Guilt-free sleeping in on weekends.\u000aWhen in Europe, one feels that one must be constantly on the go, seeing as much as there is to see and doing as much as their is to do. I miss being able to sleep in without feeling too guilty about it, or only feeling guilty because it means further procrastination on a problem set or similar task, which is not exactly a life-threatening level of guilt. Sleeping in when I could be Seeing Europe and Discovering Myself and Becoming a More Independent Person makes me feel like a Lazy Slob.\u000a6. Prices in dollars.\u000a1 euro equals roughly $1.47.  When a shirt costs 20 euros, that's $30.  I can't buy a $30 tank top.  That's just silly.\u000a7. My cell phone.\u000aI am renting an Italian cell phone, but it costs over $0.30/minute to call the US, and occasionally gets strange text messages (in Italian). It doesn't vibrate. It doesn't take pictures. It doesn't tell me what time I missed a call (just who called, and the fact that I missed it). It sometimes won't place local calls. It spends most of its time searching for a network. I hate it.\u000a8. The Dining Hall's chocolate chip cookies.\u000aItalians don't eat chocolate chip cookies.  In fact, as far as I can tell, they don't even eat soft cookies, period.  They have biscotti, and little hard cookies that go with espresso, but no big, soft, chewy, melty chocolate chip cookies.  I bought some chocolate chip biscotti, but it just wasn't the same.\u000a9. The laundry rooms.\u000aThe inside of my washer here is roughly a third or a half the capacity of an American washing machine.  There is no dryer.  I live on the first floor, so I often hang my wet laundry up in my shower during the day instead of out the window, as is the Italian standard.  It takes two days for my jeans to dry, and is generally inconvenient.  (Though, admittedly, I now feel like a dirty, wasteful American for writing that...)\u000a10. The cereal.\u000aI found my first box of Rice Crispies in Rome this week - for about $6 USD.  At Olin, the cereal is available whenever the Dining Hall is open, and makes an excellent between-class snack.  I miss my free and virtually unlimited cereal access.\u000aWhat I don't miss about Olin \u000a1. My schedule.\u000aDigital Photography is a class here.  CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?!  I run around and take pictures of things anyway. Now I get to pretend like it's homework.\u000aI'm also taking Political Development in the Third World and Intensive Italian (which is really not all that intense; restaurants tend to be much more so). I read a little and study a little, but it's not much to complain about. I don't foresee any nights where I'll be up past midnight working on problem sets or simulating electromagnetic phenomena or even writing lengthy papers. Yay.\u000a2. The distance to the nearest grocery store.\u000aMy grocery store here in Rome is a block away from my apartment. The second-nearest grocery store is about two blocks in the other direction, and is directly next to another (larger) grocery store, and across the street from the international grocery store (where I buy my maple syrup, pancake mix, and kimchi ramen noodles). The nearest grocery store to Olin is about two miles away, which is not fun to walk when laden with groceries (especially in the winter).\u000a3. The nearest historical sights (and how much awe they inspire).\u000aDon't get me wrong; Boston is pretty cool, and there are certainly some interesting historical sights, but it just can't compare to Rome. Ancient ruins abound, and sometimes in the most unexpected places (in the middle of a shopping district, for example).\u000a4. The nearest weekend trip locations.\u000aTraveling almost every weekend is so much fun. So far, I've seen Rome, Ostia Antica, Anzio, and Napoli (Naples). This weekend, I'm going to Zurich, and then (in the following weeks) I'm traveling to Venezia (Venice), Firenze (Florence), Amsterdam, Berlin (to visit Joe, another Olin student studying abroad), London, Aix (to visit Lyndsey, another Olin student studying abroad), Paris, Cinque Terre (5 villages on Italy's west coast, northwest of Firenze), and hopefully the Amalfi Coast, Pompeii, Mount Vesuvius, and Barcelona. If I had more time (and money - ack!), I would try to see much, much more.\u000a5. The soft serve machine.\u000aAs good as soft serve is, and as celebrated as the soft serve machine has been (it was installed this past summer), it can't beat gelato.  There is no contest.  Yesterday, I tried kiwi, white chocolate, and hazlenut gelato, and although the flavors were a bit strange when mixed together (next time, maybe I'll do the cream-looking flavor instead of kiwi), it was fantastic.\u000a6. The pizza.\u000aItalian pizza is so delicious.  Thin crust, fresh ingredients...  Yummm.\u000aMy friends and I went to Napoli (Naples) last weekend, which is said to be the birthplace of pizza.  The pizza was amazing. My pizza ("Nonna Carolina," named for the restaurant owner's grandmother) was topped with fresh basil pesto, chunks of tomato, and mozzerella cheese.  Really, it was life-changing.  I solemnly swear that I will never eat Domino's again.\u000a7. The coffee.\u000aOlin doesn't (usually) have its own coffee shop, though the Dining Hall does provide carafes of Seattle's Best coffee.  In Rome, on the other hand, there are coffee shops and snack bars that sell coffee in every block.  For about $1 USD, one can get a shot of espresso (the default drink you are delivered when you order "caff").  For less than $2 USD, one can get a delicious cappuccino (note, however, that cappuccino is a drink meant for the morning; don't order it after about noon or so).  Standing at the bar, eating a cornetto (pastry/croissant) and drinking a cappuccino is my favorite way to have breakfast in Italy.\u000a8.  The nightlife.\u000aBeing 20 in Boston...  What nightlife?!  If I want to go to a bar and have a drink with my friends here, I can.  It's, well, extremely expensive, but still possible.  Legally speaking, that is.\u000a9. The weather.\u000aCompared to Boston, Rome's weather is lovely.  It's very temperate here; I don't have to put on boots and a coat and a scarf and a hat and gloves if I want to walk to the next building, which is massively convenient.\u000a10. The doors.\u000aOlin's doors are incomprehensible.  They are bizarre.  They are unpredictable.  They are hard.  Freshmen spend the first several months just walking into doors.  It's very unfortunate.  Rome does not really do the whole "double door" thing, and thus the doors are not a big issue.\u000a---\u000aI hope you have enjoyed this abbreviated listing!  I'm off to sleep so that I can get up at 5:00 am tomorrow and catch a train to Zurich.  Once in Zurich, I'll be meeting up with a few Olin students to hang out and be tourists!\u000aCiao,\u000aAngela\u000a

aV\u000aSometimes I think that time away from Olin makes Olin even better:\u000a\u000aYou meet cool people that become part of the extended Olin network. Microsoft interns on the blankets having a picnic:\u000a\u000a2. You get to cook. I made asparagus wrapped crepes!\u000a\u000a3.  Free time to go visit a far away aquarium in. I went all the way down to Monterey Bay Aquarium and saw the jellyfish.\u000a\u000aBetween cooking, new friends, and new adventures... as much as I like being at Olin, summer is a refreshing change. Right now I'm down at Caltech visiting Joe Funke '10 - Olin summer gives you a great excuse to visit friends in cities you wouldn't have gone to otherwise.\u000a--Ellen\u000a

aV\u000a        Are over for 2013 (the class of 2017!) - the last one was last weekend. For current students, CW's are an exciting chance to meet future Oliners, a great excuse to take a break from work and have fun at the design build, club fair or WH open dorms, and also quite a bit exhausting - and, yes, a little better food than usual. I hope all the invited students had fun and got a good look at Olin!\u000a        Because this is my last Olin CW, I think I get to indulge in a bit of\u000anostalgia - so here are some pictures from my Candidate's Weekend 4 years ago.\u000a I came in from Oregon Thursday (along with a sizable portion of our\u000arecord-breaking delegation of 6 future Oliners from Oregon), and so got\u000ato spend all Friday getting to know the other early-arriving candidates.\u000a We designated ourselves "orphans" (Candidates traveling without their\u000aparents) and walked into Needham.There are 7 future Oliners in this picture. Can you recognize them?\u000aI\u000a also found this picture in Olin's records of my design build team. Our\u000achallenge was essentially an egg drop, where we had to build a catcher\u000athat caught and contained the egg, but also moved a little lego-man a\u000acertain distance away (upon egg impact). I still maintain that ours would have\u000a worked completely perfectly, but we had the small problem of not being\u000aable to get the egg to even hit the device! Good thing that exercise would not be evaluated.\u000aFinally, it's been said, but it bears repeating - if you're waiting on an admissions decision from Olin, don't stress about it. The sad thing about Candidate's Weekend is knowing we can't admit all the awesome students we would want to; the good part is knowing that every one of you will get into multiple excellent schools - and do just fine there! \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

At the end of sophomore year, Mike and I decided we needed a duel. The meeting request was sent for a day over a year and a half away. We finally had our (whipped creme pie) fight. Here we are, back-to-back, ready to begin counting our paces. Heena ('10) looks on, ready to signal the beginning.\u000a\u000a\u000aIt started. I landed a sweet hit on Mike from far away. I let this go to my head, though, and he charged.\u000a\u000a\u000aIn the end, neither of us really was the winner- we teamed together, though, turning our last pies against Heena.\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat a good way to start the year.\u000a(All photos taken by Alex J ('11))\u000a

aV\u000aI wanted to post more often than this, but I could echo Maia in saying that it's been a busy couple of weeks. I've had a midterm, a final (for Linear Algebra, half-semester class), a paper, and a draft portfolio, pretty much one after the other. For the sake of variety, I won't give an overview of these assignments, but I'll be sure to talk about my classes at some point before they are over for the semester.\u000aInstead, I'll think about what else this time of year means to me. It's my favorite season, to start with. I thought that fall was pretty in North Carolina, but it's gorgeous in New England. A couple of weeks ago, a few friends and I drove up to New Hampshire to go backpacking over the last 3-day weekend, and the long stretch of asphalt between Boston and Franconia was flanked by the most vibrantly-colored trees I have ever seen. Shower them over the hills and mountains we drove through and hold your breath. That's not to say that the leaves in Needham and Wellesley haven't been impressive. Great Plain Avenue, the road Olin College sits on, is a treat to walk, bike, or drive down this time of year.\u000aA picture doesn't really do the scene justice, but here is one from the trip to New Hampshire:\u000a\u000aThe air has begun to cool and the sun sets earlier and earlier each day. SAC just held a pumpkin carving, the results of which now sit near the door of the dining hall. I can't wait for the Halloween dance, when the pumpkins will be used as decoration. I miss the orange glow that used to greet me on front stoops when I went trick-or-treating as a child.\u000aHopefully I will remember to take pictures this week at all the different dance lessons I go to, because I would like to do a massive dancing post soon. It'll be fun.\u000aPeace,\u000aShannon\u000a

aV\u000a        Hi guys!\u000aIt's been a while - sorry about that! I survived freshman year, (perhaps "survive" is too melancholy of a word) and now I'm enjoying a relaxing summer working in the admissions office! I've been giving tours, answering phones (which might be the most challenging part of my job - there are so many buttons!), and meeting a bunch of prospective students. I will probably write a bit more about my job in the future.\u000aRight now I'd like to tell you about something that has taken up a surprising amount of my time lately. Cooking! I've never had to cook for myself before, and it has become quite the adventure. A lot of my friends made little co-ops of people who cook for each other, but I decided to tackle this project on my own, considering that I am almost vegan (I don't drink milk, but I like cheese too much to go all the way) and very picky.\u000aSo far I have tried two new recipes, and made large amounts of both plates - my first lasted me about a week for lunch and dinner, and I just tried the second one last night.\u000aMy first was a bean and corn salad:I used 3 different types of beans, all out of cans. There were chick peas, pinto beans, and 2 cans of black beans (yum!), as well as two tomatoes and a bag of frozen corn. I strained all the beans with my fingers because I was too lazy to go down to the kitchen and get an actual colander, and I cooked the corn in the microwave. The only thing I went to the kitchen for was to cut the tomato. The kitchens are very busy during the summer, but I figured out the secret: cook dinner at 11 pm!\u000aI threw all of that stuff into a giant bowl, added chili powder and mixed (with my hands of course). It was that simple! I ate some and put the rest into a gallon sized Ziploc bag, and finished it off slowly over the week. \u000a\u000aYay bean salad!\u000aLast night, I decided to make tabbouleh. It was significantly more complicated than throwing a bunch of beans in a bowl. I actually had to use a pot and a stove! Cooking the barley was actually the easy part. Chopping all of the veggies was the hard part. It's a small miracle that I still have all of my fingers! Also, I discovered that crying while chopping onions doesn't just happen on television. With onion tears streaming down my face, I threw my diced tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions into the barley, along with a garlic, olive oil, and parsley dressing and refrigerated it for a while.\u000aMakeshift tabbouleh\u000aI thought that I used a HUGE onion, because onion bits seemed to have commandeered the entire plate, but it turns out that a "green onion" actually means scallions, not just an onion that looks greenish. Look! Spiral Learning*!\u000aWhat I have learned so far:It is more pleasant to cook late at night when it is not crowded. Tomato juice burns the little cuts on your hands, as does chili powder. Tabbouleh is spelled with two Bs. Green onions = scallions.\u000aMaybe next time I'll try something with a pan!\u000a*Spiral Learning is a term we use at Olin for trying things out and learning from our mistakes, so each time we do it again, we get a little closer to being correct. Like a spiral!\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aA little while ago, I made a blog post about choosing my E:C major. Now, I get to think about E:C majors in a whole new light.\u000aHere at Insper, one of the projects that myself and Adam ('16) have taken on is evaluating and revising the Insper Computer Engineering curriculum. Insper is different from Olin in that, due to Brazilian bureaucracy requirements, they must have a defined course plan for a given major. That means that the students don't have too much choice in their core computing classes, but they also don't have much choice in when to take those classes. Each semester offers four to five pre-defined classes, sometimes with space for an AHS elective.\u000aAlthough the students don't get a lot of choice in what classes they take, they still get autonomy within classes on choosing projects, so that's okay. But that gives Adam and me a unique chance to design a curriculum and be very deliberate about selecting which classes will go in which semesters and why. We can apply educational theories like spiral learning and theories of motivation to justify our proposed changes to the course plan, and it's a lot of fun.\u000aBut the whole thing has gotten me thinking about defining my own course plan at Olin. Adam and I have worked with Insper to identify eighteen "disciplines", or subsets of competencies that get developed through classes. They're either technical disciplines, like "human-computer interaction" or "programming", or non-technical disciplines like "teamwork", "written and oral communication", or "product development". We made a Python script to generate heatmaps for different course plans, to see where disciplines got developed across the semesters in order to make sure the curriculum was well-balanced.\u000aSo, while thinking about all this for Insper, I started wondering if my own course plan for Olin was well-balanced and met all the criteria we developed for a Good Curriculum. Just for fun, I made a heatmap of my own planned courses through Olin. Everything past semester 5 is a total guess, but this will be the general layout of Anne's Journey Through E:C. (Before you ask, the empty 4th semester is the LOA!). The darker the square, the more classes in that semester that cover that discipline.\u000a\u000aNot bad. The non-technical disciplines have a nice spread and don't fade away as semesters go on, which is good. Some of the Insper's technical disciplines, like "memory and storage" or "networks and connections" don't translate very well to Olin's curriculum and classes, so they don't look very strong in this diagram.\u000aBut the point of this post wasn't for you to look at my (mega-cool) course plan. Planning a curriculum for someone else made me think harder about my own classes. Since I have to pick the timing of classes for myself, I have to think for myself whether it will make sense in the context of classes I've previously taken, and and do all that for myself. Making the heatmap helped me see my own course plan and evaluate for myself.\u000aSo, that's the point - encouraging you to really think about the classes you plan to take and what you plan to learn in them. At Olin, we have a lot of really cool classes, but I never thought too much about how they fit together within or between semesters, beyond the required prerequisitesand stuff, but it's never a bad time to consider which classes you take and why.\u000a

aV\u000aIt would be\u000aimpossible to tell you about everything I did in Cusco--I did and saw so\u000amany things! This photo collage is a pretty way to summarize some of what I was up to...\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCaption: \u000aFirst Row: Arriving\u000aat the airport in Cusco, modern art in the Q'orikancha museum/convent/inca\u000atemple, 22 steps carved from living stone (and some silly guides) on the Inca\u000aTrail, an illegal photo of the dome inside Cusco's cathedral, ruins at\u000aOllantaytambo, my lunch (men S./ 4, about $1.30!) \u000aSecond Row: Llamas,\u000aInca stonemasonry at Ollantaytambo, Cusco's famous 12 sided stone, me with some\u000aGIANT stones at the Sacsayhuamn ruins, Inca ruins on the Inca Trail \u000aThird Row: Iglesia\u000ain the Plazoleta San Blas, having dinner with a friend I ran into by accident\u000ain Cusco, the 'classic' Machu Picchu photo, little kids in indigenous costumes\u000adancing in Cusco's Plaza de Armas, Plazoleta Recojizo in Cusco\u000aFourth Row:\u000aExploring Ollantaytambo before hopping on a bus to the start of the Inca trail,\u000athe backside of Q'orikancha in Cusco, our Inca Trail group chillin' out at\u000alunch the first day \u000aFifth Row: Inca\u000aTrail hiking group on the first day, still clean and happy. 10 people, 7 nationalities! Plaza de Armas, gringo central in Cusco. \u000a\u000aClick see more to read about my experiences hiking the Inca Trail!\u000aWhile I was in the\u000aSacred Valley, I also 'hiked' the classic 4 day trail to Machu Picchu. It was an amazing experience, and definitely\u000amy favorite part of my trip to Cusco. It\u000ais now illegal to hike the Inca Trail by yourself--you must go as part of a\u000aguided group--and entries to the trail have been limited by the Peruvian\u000agovernment to a total of 500 a day, in an effort to help protect the trail and\u000asurrounding areas from excessive degradation.I say 'hiked' because the guided tours have evolved into quite the\u000apampered experience. \u000a\u000aFirst off, if\u000asomeone wakes you up with a hot cup of coffee at your tent in the morning, it\u000acan't really be hiking. It also can't\u000areally be hiking if they serve you pancakes for breakfast! Also, for our group of 10 hikers and 2\u000aguides, there were 16 porters.Sixteen! Hikers carry any\u000apersonal items they wanted with them, clothes, snacks, toiletries, etc, and\u000atheir sleeping gear. Porters haul the\u000atents everyone sleeps in, the food, a chemical toilet, and assorted other\u000aitems. Hikers also have the option to\u000ahire a personal porter--so that they carry only their water for the day, a\u000acamera or two, and a jacket. In our\u000agroup of 10 people, a whopping SEVEN hired personal porters. I was pretty surprised. In fact, I felt a little uncomfortable and\u000aexploitative about having porters while hiking the Inca trail. \u000a\u000aMost of the porters\u000aare from the indigenous communities in the Sacred Valley. They are often farmers with little or no\u000aeducation, and few opportunities. Recent\u000alegislation about porter welfare has helped improve their situation--the weight\u000athey carry is now limited to 20 kilos, and the tour agency must have food and\u000aadequate sleeping arrangements for the porters. Still, many of the porters walk and run the\u000atrail in just sandals. They carry heavy\u000aloads in just duffel bags or wrapped up in a piece of cloth and bound to their\u000abacks. They makes a pretty sharp contrast\u000awith the tourist hikers, with our technical fabrics and modern internal frame\u000abackpacks and hiking shoes with special extra-sticky rubber. \u000a\u000aThe company I hiked the trail with seemed to\u000atreat our porters very well. The guides\u000aknew their names, and they were always joking around with them. At the end of the trek, we had a meet and\u000agreet, in which the hikers met the porters and vice versa. The porters told us who they were, where they\u000awere from, how old they were, and what they carried. We told them where we were from, and thanked\u000athem for their service. Our group also\u000aleft a generous tip for the porters, and tipped both of our guides. \u000a\u000aThe Inca Trail was\u000aamazing and beautiful. It had sooo many\u000astairs! The 2nd day is about a 5 hour\u000aascent to the first pass, the Dead Woman's Pass, which is at 4,200 meters above\u000asea level! The third day was my\u000afavorite--the views and the flora on the undulating, nearly-all-original path\u000aup to the third pass were amazing. While\u000athe hike was fun, it was also really tiring!The last day, we woke up at 3:30 am to wait in line until the checkpoint\u000aopened at 5:30 am. From there, it was an\u000ahour of hiking to the sun gate, Intipunku, for a gorgeous view of ... mist. Machu Picchu was completely obscured, because\u000ait's the rainy season in the mountains right now. From the sun gate, we walked another hour to\u000aarrive (finally!) to Machu Picchu. But\u000aI have a horrible confession. \u000a\u000aAre you ready? \u000a\u000aWhen we got to Machu\u000aPicchu, one of my first thoughts was, "I've seen it from the top, I think\u000aI'm set. Where can I go lie\u000adown?" I was so tired I didn't want\u000ato wander around and see all of Machu Picchu! I guess that's what happens when a coffee-addict like myself misses her morning cup-o-joe. Unfortunately, the last day of the trip did not come with the wake-up coffee, due to the early start. \u000a\u000aThankfully, our\u000agroup had a 2 hour guided tour of the ruins, and then I even went and did extra\u000awalking around with folks from my tour group.Once we got past 8am, I perked up a bit and felt a little more\u000aenergetic. Still, I'll be forever guilty\u000aof thinking it would be fine to just see Machu Picchu from the top. \u000a\u000aLima vs. Leuven\u000aneeds its update! I'm going to give +3\u000afor running into friends by accident in Cusco, +2 because it never rained while\u000awe were walking on the Inca Trail, +2 for Inca mysteries, +4.2, where points\u000aare equal to highest elevation attained in a trip in meters divided by 1,000,\u000aand +1 for truly impressive stonework.At least some of the Incas must have been engineers! That leaves us with Lima 35.4 and Leuven\u000a33.9, although I have the feeling Meghan racked up plenty of arbitrary points\u000aon her trip to Paris! \u000a\u000a

aV\u000a By Maia Bittner, 2011\u000aI think I've decidedwho I want to behere! That might sound odd, but it's something that's been bothering me the last couple months (that is, who I want to be in Copenhagen) and it was particularly bothersome yesterday, as here I was, existing in Copenhagen before I had figured it out. Without a goal, I had no direction to aim myself in, nothing to work on, no way of gauging progress. Remember my last post on how I was sad to leave Boston when I didn't even have a reason for going to Copenhagen?\u000aQuestions running through my head...\u000aDo I want to be really into school (socially & academically) and organize my life around that? I'm certainly not that way at home, but this might be a good opportunity to do something different. Do I want to meet and get to know as many different people as I can? It doesn't seem like hanging out with other exchange students would neccessarily be worse than Danish students, as they're all new and from different countries, and they're also more eager to speak English and make new friends. Should I make friends with Danes outside of school? Do I want to learn Danish language and culture? Or do I want to be a loner and just enjoy the city, accepting myself as an outsider here? (I'm pretty good at being a loner. I like books and sitting in my apartment with tea and candles on Friday nights.)\u000aAs I was hopping in the taxi to the airport in Boston, Bennett told me his motto while he studied away in France was profitez, the French word for 'taking advantage of' or 'making the most of'. I think he applied it in two ways: making the most of his experience in France by doing everything, even/especially things he'd normally decline, and taking something away from every thing he did. As I rode to the airport, I tried to digest this idea, but to be honest, it didn't reallyresonatewith me.\u000aMy mission for today was to do my laundry. Not too lofty of a goal, it's practical, would make me feel accomplished, and I'd see more of the city. I found an awesomelaundromat/cafe, packed up my dirty clothes into my rock climbing backpack, and headed over there. When I got there, standing in front of the washing machines, I couldn't for the life of me figure out how much it cost (which is odd, because it should have been a number, right?). So because I didn't know what to do and there were so many people watching me and I was anxious and worried about making a fool of myself, I left.\u000a"I'll find another laundromat or something somewhere else", I thought.\u000aAs soon as I started walking down the street, it hit me, hard: this wasnotwho I wanted to be.\u000aA couple weeks ago, Bennett was telling me about a friend of his, whom hepolitelydescribed as "a man about town". His friend had once told Bennett that he realized if he could enjoy having his advances rejected by girls and laugh at the absurdity of the whole situation, he'd always win, whether he 'got' the girl or not.\u000aI had a philosophy I could get behind. I want to always win -- and I want to do that by being incredibly eager, come of that what may, and laughing at myself as I go.\u000aSo I turned around and marched back into the crowded cafe, and asked the woman at the register how much it was to do laundry. 38 DKK for the washer (about $7.50), plus 1 DKK/minute for the dryer. and soap was included in the machines, so don't put any in (good thing I asked!). I went into the laundry room, then, of course, had to come back out and ask the same woman for change. I confidently handed her 5 kroners, thinking it was 50. When she raised her eyebrows, I said "well, I'm working on it!" exuberantly, got the correct bill out, and laughed. She laughed along with me.\u000aSo what's my goal for the semester? I want to be a local, and speak Danish, and make friends here, and know where to go and how to get there and what to do. I know that's completely unobtainable, but I'm going to run as fast as I can towards that -- and trip a lot on the way.\u000a\u000aThis is a post frommy personal blog.\u000a\u000a

Luckily, she was wrong, and plenty of scallops were enjoyed by all.\u000a\u000aAt Endicott House, Matt sings along on the dance floor.  I can't remember the song.  It was amusing.

aV\u000aHey, you there! You should join the Olin Human Powered Vehicles team! (abbreviated HPV, but remember friends, "vehicles not viruses")\u000aHPV is one of the many project teams on Olin's campus, amongst such others as Sailbot, Baja, REVO, and Aero. We build bikes. Well, bikes, trikes, monowheels...you name it. Last weekend, we took five days off to drive to Florida for the ASME HPVC East competition at UCF in Orlando. (The driving took up almost 3.5 out of the 5 days - Massachusetts and Florida aren't that close.)\u000aWe raced the vehicle we'd been designing and building since the beginning of the semester:Cheryl, a recumbent, fully faired tricyle (Fairing is the aerodynamic structure around the trike to reduce drag).\u000a\u000aWe competed in events such as the women's and men's drag races (short speed sprints) and a 2.5 hour endurance race of laps around a course with obstacles, as well as a design and design innovation presentation.Cheryland Olin did incredibly well: of the 36 teams in attendance, we took third in design, third in women's drag, fourth in men's drag, and third overall, as well as winning the team spirit award. We won that final award for the perseverence and dedication the team showed even when things got tough. In the final half hour of the endurance race, the bolt holding the rear axle of our trike sheared in half when we went over a speed bump, and the vehicle was out of commission. Not to be put out of the race, Kari picked up the bike to run the laps for the remainder of the race. And the rest of Olin's team, in an amazing display of camraderie and and Olin spirit, race with her along the sidelines cheering her on. Five other teams had broken bikes, but from what I saw, none had the rest of the team running with them until they saw us.\u000a\u000aBonding with four of the five teams who ran their vehicles around the course. (Wisconsin, Missouri S&T, Olin, Toronto)\u000aReasons why you, as a prospie or future student, should join HPV:\u000a1. Building bikes! I'm not even a MechE and I love it. It's a great way to get fun engineering experience outside of classes. Designing and machining is a great thing to know how to do no matter what your major is.\u000a2. Learning how to build bikes! Maybe you read that first point and thought "Wow, I don't know how to build a bike; I can't possibly join this team." Fear not, the coolest part is that it's entirely a learning experience, and a fun one at that. I had no idea how to build a bike a year ago. This spring, I was on a subteam composed entirely of freshmen to design and build our ski/skate attachments that let the trike ride on snow and ice.\u000a3. Making friends in other classes. Because trust me, once you spend 40 hours in a car with people, you get to know them pretty well.\u000a4. Olin is a unique gender-balanced engineering school, and our HPV team has an uncommon 2:1 F/M ratio. One of the requirements of racing is having a female rider in the endurance and drag races, and some other schools don't have that, so they "borrow" female riders from teams like Olin. I think we had a total of four women on our team biking on another bike. It's fun because it gives an opportunity to bike the course and see what another team designed.\u000a\u000a5. Obviously, going to Florida is pretty exciting. Transitioning from 50 degree heat to 85 degrees sure was nice.\u000a6. Fun!\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aHi everyone! I'm Shannon, one of the new bloggers this year. Since this is my first post, I'll take a second to introduce myself. I'm a sophomore from North Carolina. I'm a MechE major, I like music and many forms of social dancing, and I wrote more about myself in my profile, if you're interested.\u000aWhat I'm writing about today is the annual (as far as I know) Olin camping trip over Labor Day weekend. Last year I didn't go out of unfamiliarity with camping/hiking and possibly fear of having no time for homework that weekend. I had only been at Olin for a week or two. This year was different. I had an amazing job this summer at a Boy Scout camp which sent me out on a backpacking trek for four days each week. As a result, I felt more than prepared (although you didn't have to have any experience at all!) to head up to New Hampshire, camp out for a night, and hike up Mt. Eisenhower the next day.\u000a        We rode up to New Hampshire in 3 vehicles, arriving at our campground at about 5:00. Our tents set up by the first Olin group (there were two trips, a Saturday-Sunday and a Sunday-Monday), we started hunting for firewood and building a fire which would cook our dinners of vegetables and chicken wrapped up in aluminum foil. While we hung out around the fire and made s'mores, the air chilled, the sun disappeared, and I felt happy so many freshmen had signed up for the trip--the ones with me only seemed nicer and funnier the more we talked. That night, the absence of moon or clouds revealed a dark night's canvas splattered with more stars than I ever see near Boston. It was such a beautiful scene that many of us decided to sleep outside just to stargaze.\u000aThe next morning, we woke up more or less with the sun (a pattern I had been used to over the summer), made oatmeal for breakfast, broke down camp, and jumped back in the cars for a short trip to the trailhead. As it turned out, everyone on our trip wanted to do the hike up Mt. Eisenhower, which had been described as more challenging than the Zealand hike. The trail: Edmands Path, 2.9 miles, to Eisenhower Loop trail, .4 miles to the peak. Elevation gain: ~3000 ft. That means it was steep. It was also a lot of fun, and I got this cool picture of me near where the path breaks the treeline:\u000a\u000aDaring and adventurous, right? To be honest, it was extremely windy at the top, so much so that you could literally lean into it! I can see why the exposure warning was there. But the view was amazing--since we were above the treeline, it spanned a full 360 degrees (if only I could take awesome panoramic pictures):\u000a\u000aTruly breathtaking. We ate sandwiches up there and took a lot of pictures before hiking back down. Just before the parking lot, many of us stopped at a small wooden footbridge over a cold mountain stream to relax and, in some cases, wade around in the water. I was exhausted and content when I got back to Olin. Then I had to do a Transport lab... but that's beside the point.\u000aPeace,\u000aShannon\u000aP.S. Here's your shout-out, John!\u000a

aV\u000aAs the semester comes to a close and everyone is busy finishing up their projects, I had a thought.\u000aWorking in groups at Olin is hard.\u000aMy Software Design team works on building Pricecod (Photo by Bennett '09)\u000aAnd, well, this is why Olin stresses team-based projects in many, if not most of its classes. The idea is that by learning (suffering?) now, students will develop the teamwork and communication skills that industry tells us they so sorely lack. There is a huge discrepancy between the engineers in corporate environments who mostly work in teams, and undergraduate engineering students who traditionally focus on individual work and projects. Olin is specifically trying to resolve this discrepancy by reforming undergraduate education to incorporate the "increased emphasis on business, teamwork, interdisciplinary design and communications skills" urged by leaders in the engineering industry.\u000aI think it's a great idea. I'm worried that Olin's approach of having mainly team-based classes is too broadly applied though.\u000a         The experience I had this semester made me feel that the structure of Olin's groups in content-based classes is fundamentally different than anything we'll see in our future jobs, and that this approach is neither helping us learn now, nor preparing us well for our post-graduation lives.\u000aWhen working in San Francisco (never as an engineer), group responsibilities were always very well defined. In some situations, I would be working with the Designer and VP of Engineering to flesh out the product roadmap.  In these meetings, we'd all bring our ideas and research to the table, and hammer out a plan.  The designer would then go make the necessary graphical resources, I would write up a functional requirements document, and the VP Engineering would work out the database design and technical implementation.  Later, I would be working with engineers to get the new feature built. They would ask me questions on the design, interaction, and prioritization of various aspects of the feature, which I would either know, decide, or go find out.\u000aIn my software design project, my three person team was at a bit of a loss trying to figure out how to divide up our tasks.  We were all learning Python for the first time, we all wanted to learn how to design software well, we had different strengths in different areas, and we wanted the workload to be approximately equal. But where to go from there? The main source of difficulty was from not having a clear goal in mind - were we trying to learn the most about something new? Learn the most from each other? Become experts in one area of software design? Complete our project in the least amount of time as possible?  All of these goals have very different work structures. I don't think this situation arises much in industry, and I doubt the usefulness of having us struggle through it.\u000aSo the question is, do teams have a place in subject-oriented classes? How much do they contribute or detract from learning?  I don't know this from personal experience as I'm just now finishing up my 3rd semester, but I suspect (hope?) that Olin's pretty good at combining its interdisciplinary focus and its focus on teamwork in classes like PoE, Systems, SCOPE, PDD, and Rapid Prototyping.  I'm excited to take these classes because I'd love to work with a team in a project/deliverable oriented class, where students from different majors (and with responsibilities corresponding to their majors) are intentionally brought together.  I think these projects both increase the depth of a student's specific knowledge within their field of study, and increase their general communication and teamwork skills. It's when everyone in a class is trying to learn about the same subject that I have doubts about the value of working in groups.  If there's a set amount of skills or knowledge students should have at the end of class, and completing a project encompasses all this learning, it seems all too easy for some things to slip through the cracks for some or all team members. Might it be better for them to do individual work rather than work in a group where knowledge and learning is necessarily fragmented?\u000aJust some of my thoughts - let me know yours,\u000aMaia\u000a

aV\u000aWhile everyone out is freaking out because their 20 credit schedule is beginning to attack them (see: /sites/default/files/blog_archives/studentblog/2014/04/the-dreaded-twenty-credit-semester.html), I thought I would take this opportunity to talk about the cool stuff I've been doing with one of the clubs at Olin.\u000aEDisco is, surprisingly, not a club where we do disco dancing or play frisbee. (Though, that would be kind of fun...)\u000aEngineering Discovery is a club at Olin for education outreach in the K-12 space. If you know nothing about this, don't worry because I'm about to tell you.\u000aA Bottle Rockets Workshop in 2013\u000aThe K-12 space is a really great place to work in and do research right now. There is tons of opportunity and a new movement toward integrating engineering and other hands on activities into the K-12 environment. Let's be honest, everyone's favorite activities when they were a kid were the ones where you got to actually dothings.\u000aAnyway, in eDisco we basically meet a lot as a huge group at the beginning of the year while everyone tries to figure out what activities they want to do, and what fits into their schedule. After that, we break off into small groups doing outreach in different places.\u000aThis semester, I took charge of an activity in collaboration with JFK Elementary School in Jamaica Plain, a multicultural and diverse neighborhood in Boston.\u000aI was extremely nervous at first, but Kathy Wright, the 5th grade teacher we were working with, made my job really easy.\u000aWeek 1: Consumerism\u000aThe first week, the Kathy designed an activity so that we could focus on getting to know the kids. Cecelia, Jess, and I worked with groups of 5th graders turned "consumers." Using vocabulary words, the groups came to a consensus about which version of a product was the best. For example, they had four lunch boxes, and they decided which was best based on cost, durability, insulation of hot/cold, and aesthetics.\u000aThe hardest part of all of it was remembering their names. They all have insanely cultural and really cool names... that are really, really hard to remember i.e. Jeysa, Cheyris, Jael, Idalis, Jonahira...\u000aWeek 2: User Oriented Design\u000aPoster board of the projects the kids made during week 2 in the JFK hallway.\u000aThe second week, we actually designed curriculum for them. We decided to try user-oriented design on them, and we chose Kathy as our user.\u000aIt was like suddenly all of the creativity these kids were not tapping into in a normal classroom setting came pouring out. They designed everything from noise-canceling headphones to cushions for the legs of their classroom chairs. They prototyped their designs with basically the whole eDisco stockroom, things like paper plates, pipe cleaners, plastic cups, cotton balls, etc.\u000aAn interesting thing I noticed was how much they identified with their home-life cultures. When asked "where are you from?" I don't usually answer Caddo Nation or Germany, but when I asked these kids, inevitably their answer was "the Dominican Republic," or "Puerto Rico," even if they had never lived there.\u000aWeek 3: Working Prototypes\u000aRahil working with a group of six students to develop one idea.\u000aThe third week we did another design activity with them, with a focus on working prototypes. They had to design something to get a key out of the bottom of a coke bottle. We used it to segway into E&M. We let them do the activity first with a magnetic key ring on the key, and they almost all used magnets. It took them all about 10 minutes to make a prototype to get the magnetic key out. When we took the key ring off, the activity became much harder and it took most of them the rest of class to do.\u000aFor those who finished early, Cecelia challenged them to use clothespins to pick up the key. This is shockingly hard to accomplish, and Jess spent two hours making her own prototype with clothespins.\u000aWeek 4: E&M\u000aCeline working with 5th graders. She joined us around week 3.\u000aWe did E&M with them for week 4. I have to say, I think it was the most successful.\u000aWe first taught them about static electricity by rubbing a balloon on our hair and then picking up iron shavings. With the same shavings we then showed them magnetic fields by placing a magnet under the plate holding the shavings.\u000aNext, we talked about closed loops in circuits by having them hook up a lightbulb to a battery. Then, we pulled out a bunch of random materials and tested conductivity and magnetism. They learned that not all things that conduct electricity are magnetic, and vice versa.\u000aFinally we showed them motors. We showed them a big motor that looked like a fan, and we showed them Cecelia's modcon project which had both motors and LEDs.\u000aSome of the most fun was how excited they got about what happens when lightning strikes your car.\u000aCecelia almost cried when Joselyn came up and told her, "Maybe one day I'll go to college and invent things like you."\u000aWeek 5: Rube Goldberg\u000aWe did Mechanical Engineering by having the kids make Rube Goldberg machines. \u000aThe first class was disappointed because almost none of them completed the activity. We noticed that the only group that did finish was the one who had only one mentor working with them directly, so for the second class we adjusted and each of us worked with one group.\u000aWeek 6: Materials Science\u000aI was really sick this week, and I didn't attend, but I know that the kids worked with Gold Nanoparticles, Magic Sand, and Nitinol wire. They learned about waterproofing, flexibility, and durability.\u000aWeek 7: Final Project\u000aTo incorporate everything we learned, we had them design water turbines as their final project.\u000a\u000aWe gave them a large motor, and they had to design an attachment that would allow the motor to spin fast enough when water was poured on it that it lit an LED.\u000aTwo of the boys working testing their design.\u000aOverall, JFK was an amazingly rewarding experience.\u000aThe kids were allowed to come to engineering if they did all of their homework and behaved for the whole week. As a result, the kids worked really hard to do both. Mrs. Wright said she saw an improvement. Some kids who never did their homework suddenly did. One kid tried to stay in school even when he was throwing-up sick because he wanted to go to engineering.\u000a\u000aSix of the girls in the class decided to enter Raytheon's Make It Better contest.\u000a\u000aSo today, on our final day, we were all really sad to leave. But all of the hugs and art we got made us really happy.\u000aA penant that Jeysa designed and everyone signed.\u000ahttp://flipagram.com/f/44EONJvmUJ\u000aI especially loved that Jonahira, who didn't seem all that interested in engineering each week, went out of her way to draw us a thank you note.\u000aSo basically, join eDisco.\u000a

aV\u000aHey you! So how's your life been? Mine's been stressful like usual, but so many interesting things have happened in the last few weeks I don't even know what I want to write about. I guess I'll focus on my "field trip" to Artisan's Asylum, a Makerspace in Cambridge.\u000aThis trip was actually part of the Hydraulic and Pneumatics Seminar I registered for. Seminars are new courses this year and Gui is teaching this specific one(unfortunately he's not teaching next year). For the last few weeks we have been learning about hydraulics and we took a field trip so we could play with some of the things in hydraulic systems.\u000aWorking with hydraulics for the first time was as terrifying as we had been warned that they had a high capacity to hurt someone if not assembled correctly. It was also really cool and frustrating at times since the direction things were pointing when they were "screwed in" mattered and we had to make sure that the systems were bled and that there was enough oil in all of the hose. Suffice to say everyone's hands were oily by the end of it, which made using tools an added challenge.\u000aThe big moment was when we let it run and nothing leaked or blew up. The cylinders all worked and everything actuated like it was supposed to. \u000aHere are some pictures. Feel free to laugh at the absurdity of our system that was so tangled it looked like a spider! :\u000aI'm so glad I took this seminar as it has taught me a lot about a field I knew nothing about. It has made me more comfortable working with slightly atypical systems that have different circuits and components. And of course going on field trips to do hands-on engineering is always exciting!\u000a~Juanita Desouza'17\u000aP.S Remember last post when I talked about ice skating? I finally found a gif of the really cool move from my favorite skater. As far as my progress is going, I've been learning waltz jumps, toe loops, and a Salchow. I can also finally do backwards crossovers!\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aMonday was the last day of the semester, Expo day. Amidst the mayhem of packing, last-minute problem set submissions, and figuring out holiday presents, every student gives a presentation of something theyve worked on over the course of the semester. With each student scheduled to stand at their booth and present for an hour per project, and attendees ranging from your family members to employees at your dream company, Expo may seem daunting at first.\u000aBut its not stressful, its relieving. Many students have spent countless tiring hours during finals week working to complete their projects and prepare their presentations for their classes, and Expo happens after all of that mayhem. All throughout the Academic Center, students are sharing their work, relieved that their hardest sprint is over. Expo represents both the passion and hard work that students put into their projects over the course of the semester. From the musical performances to ridiculous robots to media activism presentations, the diversity in student work is amazing and inspiring. Finals are over, projects are complete, and everyone, dazed by the end of the semester and the oncoming break, is happy to share the amazing projects they worked on.\u000a\u000aStudents sharing the results of their gelato making passionate pursuit at Expo.\u000aI presented a few of my projects, including a Pictionary-playing robot I worked on for my Computational Robotics class, in which you show the robot a written prompt on a whiteboard, and then it searches for suitable images online, finds a simple one that it can draw, and then runs a script that finds all of the edges in the image and converts them into a series of contours. It then filters down the number of points in these contours, and then scales them up to the size of the paper it is drawing on, and proceeds to draw the image (You can read more about it here). We took ideas from the Expo crowds to tell the robot what to draw. Below is a picture of it drawing a lemur.\u000a\u000aOne of my Expo presentations: A Pictionary-playing robot.\u000aExpo always reminds me how important it is to remember to share my work. People of all ages, including middle schoolers, prospective students, company representatives, and grandparents, come to Expo to see Olins projects. At Olin, I often feel acclimated to all of the things that are happening at the school--pancake making robots, student-built Segways, musical compositions--theyre all the norm here, and Ive gotten so used to seeing these crazy student projects that Ive forgotten how impressive they really are. All of the people that come to Expo leave amazed by the work that students have thrown together in only a few short weeks. Many people were incredibly amazed by the Pictionary-playing robot Id made, reminding me that although Id spent so many weeks working with it and debugging it, it was still an impressive accomplishment. Expo really exposes the intensity and the passion of the work that we do at Olin, and really brings to light the value of our project-based curriculum. Olins project-based experience allows students to work on and share projects that they are passionate about, which can be incredibly exciting and inspiring for both the students who did the work and the people who saw it.\u000a

aV\u000aOlin opens doors that I never would have found myself. I've loved PowerPoint my entire life- I find presentations to be fun, and people who use lists of bullet points irk me.  Yet, if you would've asked me in high school, working at PowerPoint to improve the user experience never would have been on my radar.\u000aLast Fall, I was waiting for some external guests in the Olin parking lot, and one of our staff members dropped by with Edwin Guarin and introduced me.  Through Edwin I ended up applying for a Microsoft "Program Management" internship. This internship is well suited to Oliners (three of us are PM Interns this year).\u000aIt isn't about coding, or managing- it's developing design specs for product features.  So far in three weeks of my internship I've been given freedom to explore the product and react to it (in PowerPoint slide deck form!) and now I'm working on a report. That sounds boring- but it's compelling- I just can't give you details!  Later on I'll be writing the requirements of the feature that I'm researching now, and possibly working on other features too. Our user-oriented design class has definitely come in handy in this job! My office walls are covered in post it notes (can't show you that, but here's a photo of my desk)\u000a\u000aFrom my Olin education I've been grateful about how comfortably I am working independently and seeking information from various sources within the company. For instance: I was disappointed that the "independent projects" lab was only being launched for interns in the Redmond, Washington headquarters.  I got in touch with the coordinators and now I'm helping launch the version of the project down in the Silicon Valley office.  An Olin lesson: if you're willing to do the work to get something going, chances are people will let you do it!\u000aI'll try to tell you more about the internship throughout the summer- any pressing questions? Leave a comment or send me email!\u000a-Ellen\u000aUpdate: So I've received some feedback that people would like more details about the process of working at Microsoft- which I'm more than happy to provide!\u000a\u000aI'm a "Program Management" intern- which means I spend time writing design specifications and working to make things the best they can be for the end user experience. I don't spend my time developing code- I spend it researching, writing, and making decision decisions.\u000aOn a daily basis I usually have a meeting or two to sync up with someone else on my team- or someone I'm working with remotely from Redmond.  Between these meetings I work in my office, and often converse with my office-mate, Justin (Duke) about what he's working on.\u000aWriting a specification means providing enough details about a given feature that a developer would be able to take that document and (hopefully) completely code the feature. There's always some back and forth, though.  The feature crew is the PM, the Dev, and the Tester.\u000aThe environment is way more casual than I would have expected: I have tons of freedom in my work, dress is casual, and all the free soft drinks I can drink :) I highly recommend MSFT internships.\u000a

aV\u000aIncluding:\u000aMarketing Project Piques Organic Curiosity\u000aWeekend in Normandy Heralds Historic Reflection\u000aDon't Stress Out, Career Building is for Americans\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Cold War exhibit, the Caen Memorial, Caen, Normandy.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMarketing Project Piques Organic Curiosity\u000aNANTES, France - Two American students interviewed a member of the Chamber of Agriculture this week, hoping to shed light on the role of institutional intermediaries in the growing market for organic food products. Part of an independent research project for the course International Marketing, Bennett Chabot of Olin College and Lisa Yochelson of University of Redlands hope to understand the past, present, and most importantly the future of organic agriculture, a trend currently visible in their case study nations of France and the U.S. Tentatively entitled "La Paradoxe d'un marche biologique international" (The Paradox of an International Organic Foods Market), the 15 page French report, scheduled for completion in April 2008, will examine the macro environment, producers, and consumers of the organic agricultural market. Early findings suggest that the desire for environmentally sound food production practices are in tension with the desire to have unlimited food variety at any time of year. The pair plan to follow up the Chamber of Agriculture interview with conversations with organic farmers and consumers in the organics market.\u000a Weekend in Normandy Heralds Historic Reflection\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIron rebar gripping rubble that was once a German bunker, Point du Hoc, Normandy.\u000a\u000aCAEN, Normandy - Despite having visited the D-Day invasion beaches some 2 winters past, the significance weighs heavy on a young American man standing on the sacrificial sands of a 64 year old battle field where so many just like him gave up their lives for something. I left Omaha beach and the Caen Memorial wondering: What do I believe in enough to die for? What do I think is so important that I would kill for it? WWII looks pretty noble from where I'm sitting; Would any war ever look as "just" at the time?\u000aDon't Stress Out- Career Building is for Americans\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aA French "Eolien" (wind turbine), somewhere north of Nantes.\u000a\u000aFRANCE, MASSACHUSETTS,  COLORADO, and BEYOND - For a third year engineering student, looking for summer work can be as intense a process as one allows it to be. The summer before senior year can seem like a microcosm of career searches to come. Searching for summer employment is frequently inspired by the desires for professional development and financial security, the latter of which can be particularly elusive for a  study abroad student on the short end of the telescoping Euro-Dollar exchange rate. My recent activities of tracking down potential internships has varied from inspirational (ref. Terracycle,  growing startup company that makes the greenest of products exclusively from waste and packages them in waste) to downright inconvenient (ref. hours spent by the author in front of laptop writing applications in English at the chagrin of his language compartment).\u000aThis student has decided that summer vacation should be seen as an opportunity to live in new places and learn about fields of interest. I'm encouraged by the number of opportunities to simultaneously employ and develop engineering skills in the name of environmental sustainability: I have perhaps put more effort into narrowing the scope of my search around this field, rather than in broadening my perspective to match all my possible interests, which are numerous. I think I'm making some progress on figuring out where to apply my energy in a larger quest to improve my world and make myself content.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe author in the study with the optic mouse.\u000a\u000aI stand against the notion that summer activities should be driven by an external motivation to develop one's professional competitiveness. What could feel worse than the pressure to do such and such with a summer vacation for fear of being less able to find a job later on? As one of a growing number of students with broad interests and broader aspirations for global impact, I'm searching for satisfaction in the knowledge that the chance to experiment in any position will inform the quintessential question of "What to do this summer/year/life?" the next time it comes up. Planning for the future should never outweigh appreciation of the present. Between seeing my fellow American exchange students scurrying for their internships/etc and some choice conversations with brotherly figures in my life, I've realized how much I don't want to stress out about this process. I'll reach for the things I want to achieve for the summer, but I refuse to lay awake at night worrying about. For the time being, I'll get another app or two in the email and get back to the fromage and croissants that are demanding my attention.\u000aA la votre-\u000aBennett\u000a

aV\u000aWell, it's no longer Thursday, but I have good reason for posting now: I just got back from the showing of the Candidate's Weekend 1 slide show. Candidates, remember those pictures and quotes you were asked to send in? Well, they have a few different purposes, but one is to allow the Olin community to get to know you. How excited were we to do so? Well, 150-200 people managed to cram themselves into a classroom just to catch a brief glimpse of your smiling faces. It was amazing. The energy here is off the charts.\u000aI suppose, then, that this is the perfect environment for a confession: exactly one year ago when I was where the current candidates are now, I did not want to come to Olin. It was probably number four or five on my list. Really, it was free and it had a cool prospectus. That was about it. In fact, I woke up the friday morning of candidate's weekend and vividly remember telling myself "I know I'm going to Rice, but that doesn't mean I'm not here to win." That is, just because I wasn't interested in the school didn't mean I wasn't going to give this weekend my all.\u000aThen a funny thing happened...\u000a        ...Olin decided to give its all, too.\u000aSomehow from the time I stepped on campus Friday afternoon to the time I left Saturday night, I knew that I had never wanted something so much and been so unsure of getting it as I was my admittance to Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. I could go into all the things that changed my mind and all the expereinces I managed to pack into less than 48 hours, but everyone gets something different out of Candidate's Weekend, and I don't want to spoil it for the class of 2011.\u000aHowever, I will offer some quick advice: 1) The interview is the most boring part of your weekend. You may think that you can play the system and B.S. it, or you may be scared to death. Don't do either. This weekend is a time for you to get to know the college and for the college to get to know you. For the most part, it is clear who "fits" here and who doesn't. Just be honest, and if it is meant to be then it will happen, and if it's not, you probably wouldn't have been happy here anyway. If it's any consolation, I used 10 minutes of my interview asking the college interviewers why in the world I should go to Olin over my super-top-choice school, Rice. Again, it's a two-way street. 2) It's all about the people. The students you'll meet here are amazing. Use that time to have a snow fight (like I did) or play twister in an elevator (like many of my friends did). No one here has anything to prove, because if you try, you'll end up meeting someone who's built a quantum computer or something.\u000aFinally, I have one last thing to say: Candidates, be on guard. When you're here, we'll be showing you every passion, personality, and quirk of this college. If you're not careful, you'll end up loving us more than you can imagine, and, trust me, that makes for some very hard April decisions.\u000aHave fun!\u000a-Jeff Moore, Olin College Class of 2010\u000a\u000aThese are pictures from my Candidate's Weekend. Now that I'm here, this one really doesn't surprise me anymore.\u000a\u000aOur design build competition. (My team's is on the left. We called her the "Phil."). And no, you won't be building boats. Come on, it's called innovation.\u000a\u000aThis was my team. We stayed close through decision time, and still keep in touch. The three of us here are still really close, and are even doing a yearbook page together. I'm on the right. "Montana" Mike Hughes is next to me. Then Jetsada (now at Penn), Pam (who's here at Olin) and Jessie (now at Oberlin, though she deferred and may be back).\u000aAlso, funny story. Apparently, a lot of Olin Candidate's decide to take a side trip to MIT. In fact, I first met another good friend of mine on the 10:00 AM Friday MIT tour before the weekend started. She still doesn't remember that, which might explain the really weird look she gave me at CW when I yelled to her "Fancy meeting you here." Yea...good times.\u000a

aV\u000aHi all,\u000aWe're beginning our transition to some new bloggers for this year. Keep a look out for Roland and Brad (2010), Maia and Shannon (2011), and eventually two new freshman bloggers. Our 2009 bloggers will continue to be Angela and Bennett, and I will be the fancy study-abroad blogger (if you couldn't tell from my last few posts). The rest of the bloggers from last year may pop in as summer finishes off as well. Anyway, welcome!\u000a-Jessi\u000a

aV\u000aHi everyone,\u000aIt's been awhile since we've seen a post up here.  Let's chalk that up to everyone having a great and busy summer vacation!\u000aSo far I've mostly been working.  I have two jobs:\u000a1) I work for my dad and aunt's new start up genetics company.  Right now we're working on figuring out which way of prepping DNA will be most effective and efficient.\u000a2) I work at UBS investment bank as an intern. It's mostly just a desk job, but it's nice to see what big corporations are like, too.\u000aMy other hobbies have involved going to the gym, seeing my parents, seeing a few friends who are home, and attending grad parties.  A pretty standard summer vacation.\u000aLater in the summer I'm going to be going to British Columbia on a tugboat.\u000aHave a great summer!  If you're going to be a senior, start thinking about those essays :) ...or just have fun.\u000a

I'm sure you're all going to have quite a few great options to decide between, and know for a fact that this decision time can be even more exciting, and sometimes more stressful than the application season. As you enter this phase, we'd all love to help out by answering any questions or concerns you might have about life and academics Olin, having experienced it first hand for a while now.

aV\u000a\u000aBreathing some deep cool New England air, I think back over the last 2 weeks. In those 2 weeks, I had some of the best experiences of the summer and the invigorating blast of the fall Olin kickoff. I moved back to Boston from Maine, sang, danced, canoed, swam, ate (man did I eat), trained, went to 3 days of raucous Folk Festival, wrote, started to meet the fresh faces of Olin's 6th class, and renewed my hunger to study abroad. I saw a stunning full moon, felt day after day of perfect Maine weather, heard the dulcet tones of a Yale a capella group in the comfort of my own home, and tasted the unique deliciousness that only comes from food cooked and eaten with friends. I appeared in my second independent film, with a couple sore joints to show for the violence of the performance. As Olin explodes into a renewed life, I've been having the time of mine. Want to hear about it? Come for the writing, stay for the photos.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIf my head's in the clouds, it's as happy as these ones.\u000a\u000aPhoto credit: Casey Canfield '10\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTwo weeks ago today, I was welcoming a troop of friends into my Hampden, Maine homestead. With some 15 guests, I was close to my stated goal of filling my house to capacity (we have an uncommon propensity for bunk beds and pull-out couches). This righteous crew was rallied this weekend for the American Folk Festival taking place just a few miles up the road in Bangor. Easily the most happening time of the year in this town, the Folk Festival is 3 days of folk music from across the country and around the world. Acoustic solo blues, blazing electric blues, thumb-picked guitar, Tibetan monks' song and dance, merengue, contra... This was the first time I had hit the festival as hard as I could, arriving early and staying all three days. Something about the excellent company, wandering the festival's many stages always astride a friend, and the promise of a campfire and a meal around a full long table at home made it easy to get lost in the fun that weekend.

I think it makes a lot of sense- there's so much person in the people I've met in college. There's an unnamable but tangible difference between this stage of life and the one immediately prior- this college experience has been about being open, building up an immense array of knowledge sights experiences, wildly seeing and doing everything in reach. And I've found a lot of people who live the same way- who dare each other with things like "do something that scares you every week,"  who spend their vacations at work in Guatemala, Nicaragua, Uganda, Kenya, opening themselves up to insight unimaginable to a homebody. Who else would dream up an Adventure Alarm system to wire up their suite common area into a rallying point of improvisational exploits?\u000a\u000a\u000aAt the conclusion of the Festival, we had our own festival, combining our Folk with my friend's a capella singing group- one of those high-performing, familial organizations steeped in tradition only found @ such places of higher learning as Yale. The group which regaled us on that late lazy summer eve was none other than Redhot and Blue - and although it was a private event I must here give them a public thank you for taking the time out their busy preseason retreat schedule to relax a bit with some engineers in the eye of their own storm.\u000a\u000a\u000aAfter a few other days of exploring Acadia National Park in entrancing full moon light, our crew eventually wandered south to Olin, where a flurry of reunions and meeting and moving boxes ran for the next several days. Labor day weekend is a particularly gorgeous time around here- new people excited to be here, upper class people excited either to be back or to meet new people (or to be a year closer to being finished). The long weekend saw a host of recreational activities- hiking in the White Mountains on the long-standing Olin Outing Club orientation hiking trip, a first soccer practice of the Olin Soccer club, the Man Hall naming party, a relaxing swim in Farm pond (see ukelele and djembe below), and generally getting settled in. What bits of these I have found in photograph, you will see below.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSome Oliners reclining atop Mt.

With performance begetting performance, this was the first acting opportunity directly created by my appearance in the indy feature Yellow Lights 2 years ago. This weekend's project was a short film, working title Affinity, in which I played a self-righteous kidnapper of sorts. My confused moral standing bids me duct-tape a less-than-virtuous young 20-something, played by actress Rachel Cuffe, in an effort to make her listen to my "reason." 2 days full of shooting in a dark, dusty barn threw me back into the delightful fray of the screen, seeking to make my character, the creepy Patrick, come convincingly alive. I can't wait to see what the writer/director/mastermind Dan Herzog of CT can make of our weekend's shoot. But I will say that it was a fun and challenging weekend, and I've got to be having some luck with my adventures in acting when I can spend a weekend shooting movies with people very obviously dedicated to the work they're doing. Props to the 6 who were a part of Affinity that weekend.\u000a\u000a\u000aNow, as I straighten out the many course options still on my plate and set my sights on a semester of soccer and a spring studying away in France, I'll admit I'm glad to be back. Even as the choking taste of stress tingles across my palette in these early days, I'm still excited about the things I'll do, see, learn, try, botch, and achieve this semester. As Paul Farmer would say, "To the losing battle!" I find that "salad bar" syndrome isn't just for first years- I still want to do everything at once.\u000a

p286
aVI have met people from as many different countries, if not more, as I have in
p287
aVthe last 21 years of my life (mind you, that I've lived in San Jose, Needham,

aVI think that speak for most people

aVwhat I've talked to here when I say that I have a love/hate relationship with

p305
aVbenevolent police-state can get to you some of the time, although 98% of the
p306
aVtime you don't notice it. One third of life here is all about cars, fast food
p307
aVand shopping malls. It's a part of life here that drives me insane. The next
p308
aVthird is the rich, cosmopolitan city life which can give you almost whatever
p309
aVyou want, provided that you look hard enough for it. Ex: 
p310
aVArgentinian Tango
p311
aVclasses (thanks to
p312
aVLaura Stupin ('07) who tipped me off to them), a hidden Frisbee league and 
p313
aVNYU Abu Dhabi's events
p314
aV.
p315
aVThe final third is the more traditional lifestyle lived by both Emirati
p316
aVNationals and Arab Ex-Pats. This is the hardest lifestyle to get to experience,
p317
aVbut is often the most rewarding to become acquainted with.
p318
aVAt a traditional Emirati wedding, at these events them men don't mix with\u000athe women until the end, when the groom attends the bride's half of the party.
p319
aVArab hospitality is legendary for a
p320
aVreason, and the foreigners who travel here are predominantly an adventurous and
p321
aVopen-minded bunch. When you can't find something in Abu Dhabi (like a good cup
p322
aVof tea...) you can almost always find it, and much, much more in Dubai (which
p323
aVreally should be pronounced "Du-freaking-bai" since it has so many epically
p324
aVcool, albeit superficial, things like the world's tallest tower, and a

aVOlin has its own ultimate Frisbee team and soccer team (we even have fields

aV- check out the picture above), but we are not

p368
aVmy watch to 36 minutes, so I can come switch it to the dryer.
p369
aVThen I grab my laptop and head into the lounge
p370
aV. It's been a couple of hours

aVignore emails from Randomness (one of the many mailing lists that we can

p374
aVprocrastination tool) and eventually get to homework. As I'm CADing (yay
p375
aVSolidworks!), a couple people turn on the TV and start a couple rounds of Super

aVSmash Bros.
p377
aVAt 9 p.m. I move to one of the team rooms (dorm rooms that aren't home to kids,
p378
aVbut to a plethora of whiteboards, used for team meetings that require
p379
aVquietness) to meet up with some teammates and work on a project. Generally it's
p380
aVnot a problem to meet in a lounge or antelounge (the segment of the lounge
p381
aVcloser to the stairs) to work on a project, but sometimes you need to minimize
p382
aVdistraction, and that's what the team rooms are great for.
p383
aVAt 10, the R2s (Resident
p384
aVResources) are hosting a study break, so we head out to the patch of lawn
p385
aVbetween East Hall (the newer of the two dorms, with some double rooms, and some suites
p386

p388
aVs'more-making on the grills. Study breaks happen as finals approach and we get
p389

aVCode (read the honor code

p393
aVholds us responsible for our actions, so the R2s can focus on being helpful and
p394
aVsetting up fun things to do, rather than worry about rule-enforcing. They are
p395
aVupperclassmen who are selected by the Office of Student life (with student
p396
aVinput), and there is at least one living on each floor. You can ask them
p397
aVanything, crash on their futon at night, or call them to let you into your room
p398
aVif you're locked out.
p399
aVAfter the study break, I head back
p400
aVinside to finish homework. Usually around 2 a.m. I head back to my room (if the
p401
aVprospect of staying up that late scares you, don't worry, you get used to it).
p402
aVIn West Hall, the rooms are all doubles
p403
aV. They come with two beds (twin XL, for all you tall
p404

p405
aVand four shelves, that can be stacked (sometimes it takes a little effort, but

aV\u000aIt would be an exaggeration to claim that clubs at Olin outnumber the actual students - but frankly, not by much. Olin's SAO (Student Activities and Organizations) makes it as easy as possible for groups of students to get together and pursue a common interest (okay, the crucial part for us college students is they make it easy for us to get together and get funding to pursue a common interest). Some have been around for veritable ages in Olin years, like the Ultimate Frisbee team; some are new (Noodle Club, or the tricycle racing club); some are new versions of old clubs (like the re-formation of WHACK: the Weapons Handling and Combat Kakistotracy) \u000aIn order to keep up with this constantly changing set of clubs as upperclassmen and introduce them to first year students, we start every year with a club fair where organizations have a chance to do pretty much anything they can think of to explain their purpose, show off their toys, showcase past projects, recruit new members and generally be awesome.\u000aFig. Juggling, poi and frisbee at club fair.\u000a\u000a\u000aThis year, Massachusetts cooperated by providing a lovely sunny afternoon, which let us use the Oval between the main buildings on campus (the Campus Center, the Academic Center and Milas Hall) for displays and demonstrations. Here's a few students dancing on a section of ODP's (Olin Dance Project) floor, brought out for the occasion. And here's Jared Kirschner (2013) with the sailbot built by the Robotic Sailing Club. This new club won 2nd place International Robotic Sailing Competition this summer, and are now moving towards building a boat capable of crossing the Atlantic Ocean in the next few years. Oh, and it will do it autonomously. \u000aAs a bonus, he's riding a community-owned bike provided by Olin's sustainability club GROW.\u000aAt Olin, clubs and organizations are considered part of the curriculum itself, not just an afterthought to technical coursework. If that idea is intriguing to you, it's worth looking up the "Curriculum Continuum" but the basic idea is that the learning we do happens in classes (of course!) as well as research, passionate pursuits, co-curriculars, service - to the Olin community and to the larger community, clubs/organizations and plain recreation. By the time most Oliners are seniors, they've probably experienced all of these! It's also probably part of why we're so busy - but I wouldn't have it any other way, and I can definitely assure you that the non-classwork parts of this continuum have made me think just as hard as my formal classes.\u000a\u000a\u000a

aV\u000a        Greetings, readers! You get a break from me, and instead get to hear from Chris Marra ('12) and Greg Marra ('10). Yeah, they're related. But not twins. Oliners often joke that this place is a bit like Hogwarts, so this post is rather appropriate.\u000aAnyway, Candidates' Weekends just wrapped up here, so we're all thinking about who would fit in with our strange crowd, and I suppose the Marra brothers want to put in a vote for the Weasley twins. I wouldn't mind, but personally, would prefer Neville. Or, more accurately, Matthew Lewis (*swoon*), who, incidentally, is from Leeds, where I studied last semester! My Leeds to-do list included meeting him, but it wasn't in the stars. Ah well.\u000aTo read their post, click "Continue reading". I take no responsibility for the bad parts and all the credit for the good parts.\u000aA\u000a while back I saw an article about how today's star high school seniors\u000ashould choose what engineering school to attend. It sorted Caltech,\u000aHarvard, MIT, and Stanford into the Hogwarts houses from Harry Potter.\u000aWith well-thought out reasons behind each, it was difficult to argue\u000awith the logic; it was a great mapping of schools to houses.As admissions decisions start to roll out soon, I started thinking about what house Olin would\u000a be. We're small, unique, and rebellious: a young start-up defying the\u000astandard conventions of education. Maybe we don't fit a single house -\u000abut doesn't it seem like the place of place a pair of mischievous yet\u000aintelligent young wizards might want to go to school?\u000aYes, Olin College is the perfect college for the Weasley twins.\u000aWe're entrepreneurial risk-takers\u000aThe\u000a Weasleys built a highly profitable business from their inventions at\u000aHogwarts. Olin students have created business that sell solar powered trash compactors, sophisticated yoga timers, precision coffee brewers,  and more. In the "Real Products, Real Markets" class, you'll create and bring to market your own product in a single semester.\u000aWe have the Marauder's Map\u000aHogwarts students inherited their copy of the Marauder's Map, but Olin students created ours from scratch. It uses wifi triangulation to pinpoint its users on campus, and it's even open source. Find out if people are in the design studio without leaving the dorms!\u000aWe play with fire\u000aThe Weasley twins are accomplished pyrotechnicians, putting on impressive fireworks displays for crowds. At Olin, the Olin Fire Arts Club \u000a performs using flaming poi, as well as staffs, hula hoops, swords, and\u000ajuggling pins. The club meets weekly, has excellent safety practices,\u000aand loves introducing students to new skills.\u000aYou can read the original article on Quora. And if anyone can lend us an owl, we'd like to send the Weasley Twins an info packet.

aV\u000aRight now, all of you high school seniors are nearing the big deadline. Maybe, for you, the decision was easy, and the deposit was sent in ages ago. For some of you, though, this is something you plan to be sweating until the very end.\u000aIt was three years ago that I had to make my fateful choice. I had come from a small public high school in MA, and I hadn't expected to get into any of my top schools. I applied to nine, including several Ivies and good ol' MIT, and was shocked when I got into 8 of them. My plan of just accepting the best school that would take me was no longer feasible. I had options, and while I fretted, everyone felt that they had to weigh in. The worst were the comments of "but this is a good decision to have!"\u000aSure, this was a good decision, but it didn't make it a painful one. I ended up driving around crying for more than I care to admit. In the end I chose Olin, shocking people enough that it was mentioned incredulously during senior assemblies. How did I pick? I figured out what it was that I valued about college.\u000aI knew I was going to get a good education at any of these top-tier schools. So, moving on: whom did I want to spend four years with? How did I want to learn? Was being 20 minutes from home going to be as terribly awkward as I suspected? (Answer: not really)\u000aThis, then, is my advice to all of you students on the fence. Figure out what really matters to you in your school. What school does that the best? Make a pro/con list. And if there's a school that you have a gut-feeling about, go with that gut-feeling. Did you feel like campus was home? Did you find the people annoying or wonderful? Most of you getting into Olin will have choices, and probably hard ones. Break it down to the basics, and see what really matters to you. Forget about name or obligation- go for happiness.\u000aRemember- if you ever want to chat about these things, you can always check out my author page (or anyone else's) for contact info.  Good luck!\u000a-Jessi\u000a

aV\u000a        As you may have heard, we are having a spot of winter weather here in Massachusetts in the form of a visit from our good friend Nemo. The last "historic storm" I was part of was the Pacific NW's Snopocalypse in 2008, and while the name Nemo sounds pretty mild in comparison, the NE has a very different standard of what qualifies as a historic storm: twice the snow and oodles of wind.\u000aClasses were cancelled for yesterday, and while I don't even have classes that meet on Friday, having them cancelled gave the whole day a holiday feel. It was a day of sleeping in, long conversations and blowing off work whenever I wanted to go play outside. Even knowing they are inconvenient and outright dangerous for many people, I can't help appreciating the way a big storm imposes a mandatory break in the routine, a step out of ordinary time.\u000a\u000a\u000a We are hard at work making excellent use of all this snow. Yesterday saw games of snow football (Benefit: No need of a holder for kick-off), followed by a very high stakes* class warfare snowball fight.Each class had a home-base door to defend, and also to return to for a 10-second out-of-play period following each hit. If a team's door was captured by another team, the captured team was supposed to join forces with the victors, although in practice we saw an adhoc resistance movement emerge from the occupied populaces. Afterwards, SERV (Support, Encourage, Recognize Volunteerism) held a very well-timed hot chocolate event to raise funds for a local shelter.\u000aAlso, no "huge snow storm" entry would be complete without mentioning just how much we appreciate our amazing intrepid dining hall staff who have been staying on Babson's campus just to keep us warmly fed. They are truly fantastic, and we are grateful.\u000aStay warm everyone!\u000a*Where high stakes = "for honor and glory"\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aGreetings!\u000aAs many of you may know, I have assumed my post as chair of Olin's Student Activities Committee (SAC).  SAC is Olin's largest committee (I think) with roughly 20 members (depending on how you count them), and also one of the wealthiest committees.  It receives a large portion of the aptly-named Student Activities Fee, and then, as you might guess, plans and executes numerous activities on campus.  We're looking forward to an exciting semester! \u000aSo far, we've had several fun events:\u000a1. The Welcome Back Snacks, Music, and Storytelling Competition Event Thing\u000aAfter dark on the first day of classes we met on the lawn between the two dorms (technically it's called "The Quad," but nobody actually calls it that) and built a fire in the grills.  Students roasted marshmallows and popped Jiffy Pop, and then settled in to listen to the stories, which were many and varied.  Dave '09 and I kicked off the storytelling with a tale of mild debauchery from our first year at Olin; many laughs were had by all.\u000aAll snacks were consumed save one container of Jiffy Pop, which had fallen on the ground beneath the picnic table and went unnoticed.\u000aAlso, nobody should ever let me think up the names for events.  It's not my forte.\u000a2. A Taste of Wellesley\u000aFor the second year in a row, Olin students were invited to nearby Wellesley College for a showcase of local businesses (mostly restaurants--college kids have to eat too, you know), a raffle with some pretty sweet prizes, and a dance later in the evening.  I "helped set up" by moving in a few containers of food, and got early access to the Lemon Thai booth's food for my trouble.  Well worth the effort, I must say.\u000a3. Watermelon Carving Competition at Club Fair\u000aClub Fair is an annual event put on by CORe (the Council of Olin Representatives, or the student government) in which all clubs and organizations are invited to set up a table and try to recruit new members.  SAC decided to forgo the table and just carve some watermelons along the wall in the Oval.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aUncarved melons.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMy pathetic cactus, and Michael's ('09) cube.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChen's ('11) phoenix.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe winning design.  Chris '12 carved a sort of gearbox.\u000a\u000aI carved a fairly pathetic cactus to kick it off.  Others were more successful/intricate.  The first place prize was a toy chainsaw (the chain moves, a red light illuminates, and it make a loud sort of "RRrrRRRRrrr" noise when you hold down the trigger), spray painted gold.  The second place prize was a rubbery dinosaur toy spray painted silver.  Third place was a butterfly magnet.  (It was on clearance at Target.)  It was all very irrelevant but hopefully students enjoyed it.\u000a\u000a\u000aWe had intended to follow it up with a seed spitting competition, but Eamon '09 and I accidentally bought seedless watermelons, so that didn't happen.\u000a\u000a\u000a4. Outdoor Movie Night: "Real Genius"\u000a\u000a\u000aMy proverbial right hand man, Eamon '09, set up a screen on the side of East Hall, and we all gathered on the lawn to watch one of my favorite nerd movies of all time, "Real Genius."  We popped popcorn (highly appropriate), snacked on candy bars, and laughed at all the pseudo-science (my favorite is the scene where Val Kilmer pulls a solid tube out of the freezer, calling it "liquid nitrogen").\u000a\u000a\u000a5. Suite Open House\u000a\u000a\u000aPossibly my best idea yet this year.  See the previous post (on painting underwear, by Roland '10) for more.\u000a\u000a\u000a6. International Talk Like a Pirate Day: Pirates vs. Ninjas Dodgeball\u000a\u000a\u000aI'm told the dodgeball went well.  Not sure which group won, but Joe '09 dressed as a pirate and yelled piratey encouragement through a megaphone throughout, which was (probably) quite amusing.\u000a\u000a\u000aWe also raised a pirate flag and affixed a pirate wheel to Milas Hall.  Good times.\u000a\u000a\u000aWe also have a number of events in the making, including a showing of "WALL-E" (yes, we bought the rights to show it), a scavenger hunt, a Halloween dance, the presidential debate series, and a video game tournament.  We're also working on a formal-dress event, but we're having some difficulty securing a venue at the moment.\u000a\u000a\u000aIt promises to be a fun and interesting semester, and as it absorbs all my free time and energy and is thus always on my mind, you can pretty much expect to hear more about it later.  :)\u000a\u000a\u000aCheers,\u000a\u000a\u000aAngela\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aIt has been a whirlwind month for me, starting with an amazing 7 day trip touring continental Europe where I got to explore the day and night life of Amsterdam, Rome, and Berlin (with Madrid and Lyon to follow this weekend!), followed by a week of hospitalisation, surgery, and another week of recovery while Ana '09, and my brother visited for my 21st birthday and Thanksgiving. I'm sure life is just as busy for the potential Olin '12 student reading this blog, what with the application deadline only 5 days away! Which leads me to the real topic of this post. It's ok to be gay at Olin.\u000aEven though we're a 300 person school, we have a quite a few openly gay, lesbian, and transgendered students, not to mention their countless straight supporters. This support is represented quantitatively in the actions and support of Olin and Babson's gay-straight alliance, Open. Open is one of the largest clubs on campus by financial support, and puts on some of the most loved campus events to demonstrate and encourage support for the Olin-Babson queer community, including a labor day brunch, t-shirt screening, and an annual spring drag show. Of course I can't forget our openly queer faculty, as well as very active faculty GLBT supporters. \u000aPersonally I was worried about being gay at Olin before I got here, as there wasn't much published information, and I didn't feel comfortable yet to ask around. Thankfully, those fears subsidised as soon as I met some of the queer students during Candidates Weekend. I met some great people who were engineers first, and gay second. Despite its size, I wasn't going to be alone at Olin. I can't guarantee that you'll have the opportunity to meet queer Olin students before coming here, but take my word for it, if you come here, you'll be accepted by the community, and you might even find someone you like. That and, Boston's an awesome place to be gay. Myself, I've slowly met a great group of on and off-campus friends, I swim competitively with a gay USS masters swim team, and now that I'm 21, I can't wait to go out on the town occasionally. \u000aOf course if none of this suits you, you can always use study away to have a different experience. I might suggest a large metropolitan area renowned for it's extremely large queer population and nightlife... ;)\u000aFeel free to contact me if you want to know more.\u000a

aV\u000aAt about 11pm this past Sunday night, Jessie Sullivan, the R2 (resident resource -- Olin's version of RA's) came into our suite, asking my suitemates and I to head downstairs immediately to the first floor common lounge to hear an announcement from Rod Crafts, our Dean of Student Life. On a campus that runs on email, we could tell this was something out of the ordinary -- but besides half-serious, mostly facetious speculations, no one really knew what to expect.\u000aWe got downstairs in time to catch the tail-end of Rod informing us that there had been a motor-cycle accident in Dover, Mass, that had resulted in the death of one Olin student, sophomore Matt Bowes, and critically injured another, first year student Rachel Karis.\u000aI didn't really know how to respond then, and can't claim to now. I knew Matt, and recognised Rachel, but wasn't particularly close to either of them -- but within a community with 300 students, each person is a presence felt. We heard again on Tuesday that Rachel too had fall prey to her injuries.\u000aWe heard about Rachel literally minutes before all the seniors had to put on our corporate faces and head out to meet our SCOPE sponsors and liaisons on Tuesday. Many other students were either in class, between classes or headed to various meetings and commitments. It's a pretty uncomfortable feeling for us here to try to balance appropriately responding to everything that has just happened with maintaining structure and normalcy in our everyday routine. I can't even begin to imagine what this week must be like for the two families.\u000aOfficial updates on family and campus services for Rachel and Matt are available here. We hope that you will join us in remembering them, and keeping their families in our thoughts.\u000a

aV\u000a When I was in Chile, the third step in at least 90% of conversations I held (at least with new people) concerned my major: Where are you from? -> Why are you here? -> Oh, what do you study? I had a strong incentive to derail this conversation train because I knew I was going to mangle the word for engineering irreparably, but I usually wasn't successful. After we finally got through my stumbling through "ingenera", the rest of the conversation proceeded apace (in Spanish):\u000a"What kind?""Mechanical""Oh, can you fix my car?"\u000aHalfway through the semester, someone explained to me that the word I was using for mechanical (engineer) was really (shop) mechanic. What I really was, is a "civil engineer" - the opposite being a "commercial engineer" in management/business.\u000aBut really, even in a language I'm certain about, I get asked to fix a lot of things once I'm identified as an engineer. I love it. Engineering is technical problem-solving; we fix things - processes, machines, tools, paradigms, your great-aunt's computer, whatever you've got. \u000aBut especially your great-aunt's computer. Why? Well, because you're an engineer and it's your family, and I just can't resist that combination. So when I go home, I love it when my family suggests things to fix - and this time they had a more out-of-the-ordinary problem: how can a person with minimal muscle strength play with their 70-lb dog? \u000aKeep reading for the answer...\u000aAns. Pulleys! Congratulations!\u000a(I will also accept "levers!" because that's a pretty safe answer to any mechE question, and really, pulleys are pretty much just a way of doubling over a flexible lever).\u000aHere's a 1st prototype I rigged up after a quick visit to a hardware store. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSystems of pulleys are awesome. They let you trade distance (how far you pull your end of the rope) for force (how hard you have to pull to exert a desired force on the other end). In the pictures above, the pulley in the right-hand corner is attached to a large post as an anchor (by the black strap). The dog is pulling on a toy attached to the second pulley, and a person is pulling on the line pointing to the left. \u000aHere's a simplified diagram. Basically, the force of the dog pulling is now split between the rope going to the person, and the rope going to the anchor - so to win this game of tug-of-war, the person needs to be pulling just more than 1/2 as hard as the dog.\u000aI think before I came to Olin I would have been much less likely to actually build something like this. Not that it really required any particularly difficult technical skills, but I hadn't quite realized I could just go get stuff and make a rough draft of an idea. But after 3 (and counting) years filled with projects and a "bias to action" (better to do something and fail than not do it at all - within limits!), it just seemed natural to me to pull together a prototype and see if I could actually make it work, instead of just thinking about it. And I think Aston (the dog) agrees:\u000a \u000a\u000a

Last fall, I tried to continue at Olin, but it was just too much work.\u000a\u000aThis year though, everything just seems to have fallen into place, and I've gone rock climbing every weekend since the school year started. It helps that most of my friends have gotten into rock climbing too! I'm trying to get in as much climbing as I can before the cold weather restricts me to a gym.\u000aJona ('09.5), has been doing a lot of work with CoRe to get some funding for rock climbing. Last weekend, he organized a school-wide trip to RockSpot, a nearby gym, for people to learn how to climb. Based on the popularity of the outing, it looks like the student government will pay for Olin students to climb at both RockSpot and the Boston Rock Gym in the future, which I'm very excited about!!\u000a\u000a\u000aIndependently, my friend Pam ('10) is doing a Passiyonate Pursuit in rock climbing this semester, with funding from the Office of Student Life. I see her every Thursday at MetroRock.\u000a\u000aBack to homework now!\u000a\u000a\u000aOlin students climbing in Rumney, NH.\u000aFrom left: Eric ('07), Jona ('09.5), Maia Bittner ('11), Bennett ('09), Gui ('09), Casey ('10)\u000a\u000a

aV\u000a The Greenhorn Summit, hosted by Greenhorn Connect, was Boston's first student-run Entrepreneurship conference. Between presentations, break-out sessions, a mini-career fair, and the obvious networking opportunities, the event was an incredible experience. The event also prodded me to think more about E!, Olin's curriculum, and the purpose of education.\u000a        I took a lot of notes during the Summit, thinking I would post a quick-summary of them all. They're interesting - "Every entrepreneur wants another entrepreneur's business model", "don't read tech. blogs", "be a super-hero at one thing and decent at everything else" - but like all tips, tricks, and tidbits of advice, they are all dependent on context and interpretation. So here are the 4 (and a bit) interpretations and reactions I took away from the entire Summit.\u000a\u000a\u000aOlin actually teaches a lot about Entrepreneurship.\u000aIf you haven't heard, there's a growing concern amongst the Olin community that E! at Olin is dead. The Foundry is mostly empty, there are hardly any ventures being started by students, and the E! curriculum is undergoing a major re-evaluation. But listening to the speakers and panelists at Greenhorn, Olin seems to touch on a lot of things that define entrepreneurs. Rob May, CEO of Backupify, claims that "The number one trait of entrepreneurs is passion, but the number one skill is to dive in and learn quickly". Passion and learning-on-the-fly. Where have I heard those before?\u000a\u000aIt's not what you know, but who you know.\u000aThis was a fact already known to me, but Greenhorn was also the first E! conference I had ever been to. It seemed like everyone got started by knowing someone, even if that connection started as a hopeful email asking for help. Relevant coursework and cool projects can help make a case for you, but only if you have someone to show them to.\u000a\u000a"Projects serve as context for conversation"\u000aThis was my favorite quote from the entire Summit. Working on projects - whether they be for class, for a hobby, or for a friend - is one of the most important things you can do. They build your skills, hone your passions, but also serve as evidence of you as a person. Being able to go up to someone and say "here is something I'm working on, let me showit to you - I'd love to hear you thoughts" is so much more powerful than "Hi, I need a job".\u000a\u000aSchool is not enough.\u000aPerhaps this reaction is due partly to the way my coursework has been going recently, but it seems increasingly apparent to me that school is not enough - not even close - to prepare you for the real world or open opportunities to the things you want. Or rather, a single school's curriculum is not enough to meet all of your demands, so it is important to recognize what skills and knowledge you need or want to acquire and make time to learn them. This is where somewhere like Olin both fails and succeeds. Our small size means there are no product design, graphic design, or industrial design courses (i.e. the courses I most want to take these days), but with programs like Passionate Pursuits or Independent Studies, I can find a way of dealing with our curricular deficiencies.\u000aI still don't consider myself an entrepreneur - I don't have that single, over-bearing vision of where my life is going or thewillingnessto put everything on hold for one project - but Greenhorn made me realize that E! is still very much the field for me. I might not have what it takes to start something right now, but the beauty of the start-up world is being able to find and craft a space that lets me do what I want to do. It's a bittersweet revelation - I definitely have a better sense of what I need to do with my remaining time at Olin, but it also makes me wish that Olin's connection to E! was stronger. Unlike some of my peers, I don't view school and E! as mutually exclusive - classes like Real Products / Real Markets make that obvious - but it also seems far harder than developing a strong design curriculum or even re-thinking the way engineering courses are taught.\u000a\u000aA few weeks ago during Representing Olin, we were joking about re-naming the school from "Olin College of Engineering" to "Olin College of Innovation". We are all quite jaded with regards to the usage of "innovation" - it's a term with far too much usage and far too little definition to be very meaningful - but the more time I spend in the world, the less I feel like an "engineer" and more like.....something else, an occupation without a description, something that combines the left and right sides of the brain in some bizarre mix of form and function, empathy and marketing, mastery and incompetence, direction and flexibility.\u000a

aV\u000aSo, in case you haven't picked up on it, Olin is a place where you can tend to be in meetings almost as much as you are in classes.  Today, for example, I had at least 4 meetings, taking up at least 3 hours of my time, but the last one was by far the best.  The CORe Constitution Committee was meeting to go over some amendments, and we kept getting sidetracked and just having fun.  In fact, it resulted in a ton of laughter, and one e-mail sent out by Greg Marra to randomness.... hmm... something similar happened during our KITTEH meeting (a CORe committee trying to get a dorm kitten) with icanhascheeseburger... maybe i'm the common denominator here in getting massively off topic...anyway, afterward, I was looking at the Olin website, and finally went to the Flickr account.  It is actually really cool, and I don't know why I've never looked at it before.  I was having an especially good time looking at the Freshmen orientation pictures (which I was at...most of... because I'm an R2), and the Olintastic pictures in particular.\u000a          Brief, explanation, Olintastic is basically something where the R2s get up in front of all the first years and have fun making complete fools of themselves and hopefully entertaining them while non-freshmen begin to move in.  As part of this, we decided to have a talent show... but where we wouldn't be performing our own talents, and would instead get a half an hour of instruction for learning someone else's talent.  mine was learning to play the guitar from Erik Kennedy, and I thought I'd share the picture.  http://www.flickr.com/photos/olin/1483166691/in/set-72157602257396936/\u000aYeah, so other than meetings and stuff, my weekend was kind of like the past hour has been:  I have some work to do, but it doesn't feel incredibly urgent, so I'm getting distracted a lot, but having a good amount of fun.  Now, all of this could have been the result of being stressed and totally busy all of last week, but I feel like it's important to have these sporadic times of lapsed productivity but increased hilarity.  Keeps me sane.  Also, the weather was so beautiful today, that I just couldn't help but be happy, and part of my MatSci lecture got to be outdoors!\u000aAnd, I'm going to end with a little shout out of sorts to my parents who came out for Family Weekend the weekend before this past one.\u000aI had a great time, and it meant a lot to me that you guys came.  I love you, and I hope you had a good time as well!\u000aProbably annoyingly perkily yours (and I'm not going to lie, on a bit of a sugar rush),\u000aJessie\u000ap.s.  can you use that many adverbs in a row?  :)\u000a

aV\u000a        Despite being fairly busy, this past weekend has had lots of opportunities for de-stressing and having fun, starting with double holidays, since it was both Easter and Passover. Saturday night, some friends invited me to eat the Seder meal-and kindly accompanied it with a follow-along transliterated flow chart.This was a first for me, and something I'm glad I got to experience. Later that evening I went to the Vigil (a late-night Easter church service) and ran into some Needham-ites I know and hadn't seen in a while-it's always nice to feel like I know local people. The next day, OCF had Easter dinner-and just as I was recovering from the jelly-bean induced coma, SAO/CORe (student government) stepped in to prepare for elections with a study break featuring blocks of chocolate so big we had to take a hammer to them. \u000a\u000aSo, Christos Anesti, Happy Passover and remember to vote!\u000a

aV\u000aI just recently acquired some vocabulary in Arabic that I know no English equivalent for. Now I'm not talking about the names of dishes or idioms here in Cairo, but words for things that are common and regularly sold in the US; things like art supplies. How did I learn these words?\u000aI went out and bought art supplies.\u000aNow this may not sound like a big deal to many of you, but I have spent my entire life avoiding anything that seemed remotely similar to an art class, particularly those dealing with drawing.\u000aHow did I end up in this situation? Well registration here is a bit ... convoluted. There were no consistent directions for how or when to register, and the directions that did exist were sent to maybe half of the study abroad students. So when I came to Cairo, I hadn't registered for classes didn't know how to register, and, by the time I did figure out how to register (after many hours sitting in the international programs office) most of the 200 level anthro, polisci, and history classes were filled. So while I was sitting in the international programs office, I thankfully flipped through a schedule of classes book and picked out a few more classes by the "interesting title and does-it-give-me-a-three-day-weekend" rule. This is how I came to register for "Architecture: Art or Engineering". A bunch of the other classes I wanted were full, so when this one fit in my schedule and seemed interesting, I decided to take it.\u000aWhen I signed up for the course, I thought the class would be slides, lecture, essays - a fluff engineering course. The listing I saw was colored under "architectural engineering," so I thought the course might also involve doing a few easy engineering problems. Boy was I wrong. My first clue was the classroom - it's an art studio. No hiding it. The next tip off was the design (and I mean graphic design) professor from the art department who was leading the class. In the first class, he did the traditional "who you are, why are you here" routine that is very common here; it turns out that the class is primarliy business and art majors, with myself and two architecture majors being the only other majors. Little did I know that the course was cross listed in the art department when I was signing up for it.\u000aThings got tricky for me in our first assignment: to draw our dream house. In pencil. I can't even draw a remotely straight line and at the end of class, my picture was hung up next to an art major's. It looked even worse because I only had a pen with me and had to ask the TA where to get a pencil. Thankfully there's an engineering prof co-teaching this class who wasn't at the first class, so in the next class I won't be the only engineer in a class that has engineering in its title. Still, even on the first day of class I was already being called on to represent all of America in our discussions.\u000aBasically, this class is another cultural immersion for me on top of the whole "being in Egypt" thing. I didn't recognize half of the things on my supply list for the class, and it was written in English. The TA then was kind enough, because I'm the only foreign student in the class, to draw a map of where I could find art supply stores near campus and then translate my supply list into Arabic so the storekeepers would have a clue of what I was looking for. Even then it took, in addition to my weak grasp of colloquial Arabic and the translated list, gestures, pointing, and drawing to convey what the heck I was looking for. Fortunately, most Egyptian shopkeepers find my lack of arabic cute and most exchanges involve jokes and laughter rather than frustration. In the end I got the supplies I need for my next class on Thursday and spent about 100LE on art supplies. At the time, this felt like a lot, since lunch here is about 3LE, but really, my 100LE of art supplies cost me about $18, which I would certainly consider a bargain in the states. It's strange how quickly my sense of price transitioned away from the dollar.\u000aBut back to the words I learned. The first of these was stambet fash and it's a plastic sheet where you can trace out details for blueprints and floor plans like sinks or bathtubs. The second was shiffef which is a smooth thin sheet of yellow-ish tracing paper. Finally there is another type of paper called kelp which is used for similar things as shiffef but isn't as nice. Now I just need to learn what these things are called in English.\u000aPictures from class coming soon - as long as they're not too embarrassing\u000a-Ana\u000a

aV\u000aHello from Olin! It's been a long while, and now things are even busier (I feel like I say that every time I make a blog post?). With half the semester left, classes are moving into project phase. Since projects are all I can think about right now, I'll just detail a couple (meaning all) of the cool things I'm frantically working on. Our human powered vehicles team is going to competition in two weeks and there's still plenty to do- I'm working with a subteam that's building iceskates/skis to attach to our vehicle. You read that right, our trike is going to have skates. We're hoping to build it and test it out on a ice rink soon. It's pretty rad.\u000aIn RWM, our electronics/data measurement class, the team I'm in is working on an EEG to try to read brainwaves. In Software Design, Mike and I are programming a chess AI and we're hoping to train it using Machine Learning. In Markanics (Mechanics taught by our lovely instructor Mark Somerville), Michael and I are modeling and simulating wheelies on a motorcycle.\u000aMeanwhile independent research is coming along- I'm working on computer vision for a quadcopter that we want to use to track whales. It's not an easy problem, so a lot of my research so far has been preliminary work learning about computer vision and object detection. It's been a lot of weeks learning about algorithms and wrestling with Labview (and then switching to OpenCV). I'm hoping to get a few demo programs up and running that can track objects (with consistent lighting and a stationary camera) by the end of the semester, and building a robust program that can track whales is an aspiration that'll probably have to be left to this summer or the next year of research.\u000aIn the Machine Learning reading group on campus, I'm working with a subteam of students who are working on building a vision system for a robotic tour guide that we're envisioning. We're taking baby steps right now, so our first goal is to get a waffle detection program up and running. Why waffles? Well, they're relatively symmetric to rotation, generally the same color, and easy to find features the features of. Also, waffles. \u000a"Well, hold up there Dennis!" You might say. "That sounds exceptionally busy! Are you even able to do good work on all these awesome projects?" My answer is that I really hope so! Part of being a freshman at Olin is finding that you're overcommitted and trying to balance everything. So only time will tell, but drinking massive quantities of caffeine is helping. By the way, I know multiple people who are taking more classes than me and doing more extracurriculars. If you're wondering how they do it, I don't really know either. But a phenomenon I've noticed is that upperclassmen scoff at you and think it's cute when you say that you "don't have enough time" or "have too much work". So it looks like things are only getting harder from here, and I'll have to start narrowing down extracurriculars next year.  \u000aWhat else is going on with my Olin academic life? (If you were hoping for non academic details I'm sorry, it's just about all my fried brain can write about right now). Well, "oh crap, I have to choose a major" is looming somewhere in the future. You'd think that Olin makes it easy for you because there are all of about 5 majors, but the more I think about it the more unsure I get. I've gone from thinking I'll be an ECE to a ME to being an ECE who's actually a computer science major. Turns out I like programming, as you might guess from all the stuff I'm doing with computer vision and AI and machine learning. (By the way, never dismiss a field because a subfield of it isn't your cup of tea. After spending a few months learning Rails and web app development I just wasn't too into it, so I thought I couldn't be a computer engineering guy. But computing is a huge interdisciplinary field with a lot of cool schnaz, and I've since changed my mind).\u000aSo this is what Olin is for me right now- lots and lots of cool projects and work. Tune in next year (I believe this is my last blog post of the semester) to see the results of it all and what major I finally chose! Or just email me or something if you're truly curious (yeah right). By the way, prospective students who might be reading blog posts, never be afraid to email and talk to anyone at Olin! Oliners are a friendly bunch and would probably be pretty happy to talk to you. Just about everybody here stays on top of their emails. And...that's just about it for this blog post. Bye friends!\u000a

aV\u000aHowdy. First-year Charlie here. Some stuff about me. I'm from Houston, TX, coming out of a private Catholic high school. I am big into basketball and Ultimate and did three years on a FIRST robotics team, Spectrum 3847. I heard about Olin through my counselor and really found the hands-on curriculum and extremely small community as things that I can thrive around. \u000a\u000aOkay, enough with the intros, I am here to talk about Olin. We are close to three weeks on campus, and reality is starting to set in. I am currently sitting in on some alumni who are now working at Microsoft. They are saying some really cool things, but they just mentioned the fact that Olin teaches to have fun, even when you have a ton of work to do. I can definitely testify to that, even though I have only been here for three weeks. I am already mastering the art of multitasking. I'm listening to them talk while working on this post. It is often said around campus that most Olin interactions occur over a laptop. This is essentially necessary to stay caught up with everything that needs doing here at Olin. \u000a\u000aSo first, I'll give you an idea of how generally busy we are so far. All first-years are enrolled in Modeling and Simulation (essentially a MATLAB class at this point), Design Nature (engineering process and solidworks), Modeling and control (electrical and robotic basics),Olin Introductory Experience (OIE, basically an extended orientation), and an AHS (arts, humanities, and social sciences class) course. You should hear a lot about these classes from a lot of the other first-year's posts, so I won't go into crazy detail on them. My AHS (pronounced 'oz') class is The Digital Eye: Photography, Vision, and Visual Communication. We are also allowed to enroll in a variety of co-curriculars, extraneous courses that take up a small amount of time but do end up on your transcript. I only enrolled for the Couch to 5k this semester. \u000a\u000aSo, all of that wordy stuff adds up to 16 credits this semester. Once you start thinking about all the homework that we get from these various classes, it becomes very apparent that the idea of being "done with all my work" does not exist on this campus. So far, Olin has literally been moving from one deadline to the next, with little time to think about what fun things I can do with free time. The term "study break" is used very often on campus. This is the time set aside for non-academic activities. There is no notion that you have nothing that you need to be working on. It is more of a "I just finished some work and I am just about to start more work, but I can squeeze in some time to go throw the disc around on the Great lawn" kind of idea. In reflection, it is kind of funny how quickly us first-years have adopted this Olin vocab. It is probably the only sensible way to stay sane on campus.\u000a\u000aTo give you an idea of what I am talking about, below is a picture of my google calendar for the last week (open it in a new tab to make it all readable and stuff):\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI don't usually put my class schedule into my google calendar (I use an awesome app called timetable. It even silences my phone during class!), but I figured it would give you more of an idea of what my weekly schedule might look like. A lot of people use their Outlook calendar to organize things (that is the way they give us to process emails), but I decided to forward my emails to my gmail and do everything from there, which has been working fairly well for me. I am sure you have heard about the volume of emails that you get here, and honestly, it was a large source of stress for me during the first week or two, but I have gotten a pretty good handle on it now.\u000a\u000aNon-sequitur. Olin is absolutely full of FIRST robotics nerds. FRC is something that I was very passionate about in high school, and I cannot describe what it has been like to come to a small school like this where every other person did FIRST at some point. I have had some great conversations with Nagy, another first-year, about his time on team 254, The Cheesy Poofs. His team was kind of iconic for me, so to have some great robotics conversations with their 2013 President is pretty freaking awesome. I'll end this random rant here, because I could ramble on and on and I am sure neither of us would really appreciate that.\u000a\u000a\u000aI'll finish up talking about my friends and my AHS class. I have met so many amazing people here already. The atmosphere is so chill. The people are naturally looking out for each other and everyone is just great to talk to. I have already found people that I could easily sit down and talk to for hours on end, or do any task together and have fun while doing it. That is my study group. We hang out by doing homework in the same room together, but that is still better than doing homework by ourself? That is basically my attempt at being social. \u000a\u000aSo my AHS class. There are twelve(?) of us and the first thing we did during the first day of class is get our equipment. We got one awesome Canon 60D DSLR camera with an 18 to 138 lense along with a heavy duty tripod. As someone who had never held a DSLR camera before, this was crazy to suddenly have a very high end camera to work with. I have thoroughly enjoyed playing around with the camera, and making what was a mini-hobby of photography to something that I enjoy doing and am actually kind of good at! Below is a picture I took with some friends (I am on the left in the Texas Torque shirt, I am not from Texas Torque), along with a link to a photo blog I have started up to give me a place to put non-class related pictures that I have taken and sometimes edited with my equipment.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMy blog can be found at charlieslens.blogspot.com!\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks for reading! Hope this was informational/entertaining. \u000a\u000a\u000aBest of luck to you in your future endeavors,\u000aCharlie Mouton '17\u000a

aV\u000aHey all- sorry about the lack of posts last week. As Ellen mentioned, it was spring break, a time when you realize how wonderful having a wired campus is.\u000aCurrently the campus is something else too- namely, extremely paranoid. Why is this? Because SAC (the Student Activities Committee) is sponsoring their annual Mafia game. Students form families, headed by a don, and try to stay alive while hunting down another family. Every participating student is issued a small water gun. The trick is that they have to somehow get it without being seen, even though the box is located in a main lounge. At first I didn't think that the game would affect things so much, but people have been getting more and more into it. Information has been exchanged or hoarded, students are turning on their roommates, and even a simple hug could be your death. I think this is the first time I've seen some doors locked.\u000aAll of this is headed by the Godfather himself, a fellow by the name of Erik.\u000a\u000a        As I write this,  a  student  just walked by holding a webcam that's broadcasting his surroundings to his roommate, just to make sure that he always has an impartial witness. There's a splash of water on the glass window, and I've already been asked to escort one of my classmates to his room.I may have already died, but I'm certainly enjoying this. SAC sponsors all sorts of things, from dances (including one this Saturday that is Masquerade-themed) to movie outings, but this has been one of my favorites so far. Things like these make me appreciate how close Olin's size makes its students- even when they're trying to shoot each other.\u000a

aV\u000aI've always been impressed by the importance that Olin powers-that-be place on community service and the dedication that our student service organization (SERV) exhibits. The Olin calendar has a block of time every Friday afternoon, beginning at 3:30, designated for service activities. No classes, no school-wide events, no required gatherings of any sort.\u000aSome students find their own way to give back during this time, and for those who don't, SERV works hard to bring opportunities to them. This past Friday, there was a flurry of activity, likely aided by the glorious weather.Engineering Discovery, a service group on campus dedicated to science and engineering outreach in preK-12 settings, was busy preparing for a survival skills/lost in the jungle workshop the next morning. Twenty-eight local elementary school students were on their way to make their own rafts (to transport supplies), water filters, and blow darts (to learn about projectile motion).\u000aSome of the supplies, including a menacing alligator...\u000a\u000aHard at work...mostly...\u000aOutside on the Great Lawn, volunteers were hard at work with SERV, building benches for the Dedham Animal Rescue League.\u000a\u000a\u000aI love having the opportunity to provide service to the community without leaving campus, and the break from our Bubble is welcome every Friday afternoon.\u000a

I feel a little overwhelmed, but I hear others saying they feel the same way, and it's somewhat comforting. While we all work on final papers, projects, presentations, and exams, I want to remind my classmates to take a deep breath every once in a while, or a nap. You deserve it. \u000a

aV\u000aMy dad, my sister, and I landed in Brussels Intl. Airport last week. The three of us had a week of vacation in Europe before I started my internship in Belgium for the summer. And so, we got to it!\u000aBrussels is a fascinating city to walk around in. It is a city merging the old with the new. The preserved architecture of the churches and stock exchange and city hall put me back into Medieval Times. Yet on the other side of the city, stood the towering glass buildings of NATO and the European Union. \u000aOne of my favorite monuments to see was of a little guy. It's called Mannequin Pis. And well, it is a statue of a little boy pissing. And there is a story behind this one. Long ago, the duke of Belgium, 2 years old at this time, had his troops battling in a war. The troops put the infant lord in a basket and hung the basket in a tree to motivate them. The little boy urinated on the opposition, who eventually lost the battle. Victory was attributed to this savior of course. And this little boy is revered indeed. The whole street leading up to the monmument is covered in waffle and frites (fries) and chocolate shops named after him. It was great. He was even dressed up in a soldier costume that day.\u000aMannequin Pis\u000aAnother cool monument in Brussels is the Atomium. It was built 60 years ago for the Brussels World Expo, and is a giant Fe (Iron) atom. It was pretty awesome to enter each atom of the monument. We even sat in the very top atom and ate in the restaurant inside. It was a landscape view of the whole city of Brussels.\u000aThere's me, with one of the Atomium atoms just below.\u000aSoon after this, the family was headed to Amsterdam, a city famous for quite a few sites. We mostly walked the streets of the heart of the city, around the canals and the dozens of bicycles parked everywhere! Europe really is a biking and public transport continent.\u000aAnd our trip to Amsterdam was mainly for my dad to see the renowed Tulip Kukenhof Gardens. It is revered world-wide for its flowers from May-March every year. Luckily, we got there on the last day it was open! Most flowers had been cut, but the gardens were still pleasant to walk around. Below is a picture of my sister, my dad, and I with some red tulips behind us.\u000a\u000aWith this whirlwind trip now a week ago, my family headed back to India and I've been in Leuven, Belgium. Becca ('13) Mark ('14) joined me at the start of this week for a 10-week internship program at imec, a nanotechnology research institute. Becca will be working with magnetic nano-particles, while Mark and I are designing and engineering for electric vehicles of the automotive future.\u000aThe three of us are headed to Amsterdam tomorrow to see Michael ('13) and spend the weekend there. It's an early train to catch and I'm heading to sleep soon. I'll keep in touch about my European adventures every few weeks. Goedenacht! (Goodnight! in Flemish =)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aV\u000a        It's two in the morning, I have a design nature hopper to finish, a found percussion piece to write (don't ask), a modcon lab and prelab to write up, AND a diagnostic due on Friday, but there is something else I want to talk about, and that's completely outside of what you think of "engineering".\u000a\u000aI'm a solver of practical problems, or so Dell Conagherwould say, and that invokes many images outside of just sentries, hopping toys, and the survival of marine life. One "practical problem" that I've been working on for the past week is FWOP's rendition of Dr Horrible's Sing Along Blog. It will be put on today the 11th of October (at a more reasonable hour), the 12th, and the 13th, and the cast and crew have put the entire show together in just over a month (and with under a week in the theater!). My roommate, Myles, was cast as Dr. Horrible himself, and due to his strikingresemblancehe is now referred to as Neil Patrick Freshman.\u000a\u000a\u000aQuite striking, isn't it?\u000a\u000a\u000aMy responsibility for the show was designing and operating lighting. My friend Justin, a fellow freshman, grappled the practical problem of sound. Together, we spent long hours yelling into mics, burning fingers on hot lights, switching gels, yelling into headsets, running up and down from the booth, yelling down from the booth, yelling up at the booth... Lots of yelling. It gets very stressful trying to make sure everything is working, and then all of a sudden things break horribly (pardon the pun), your lighting cues get messed up, you have to reprogram a long string of cues to ensure that the one light that seems to pop on at the worstmoments is blocked out. However, when things like that happen, I remember being in the modcon lab, and trying to debug strange problems while Oscar hovers over your shoulder smiling as you work.\u000a\u000aOlin's pretty good about giving you problems and the tools to solve them. Olin is also very good at letting you discover the solution. It reflects not only lighting, but also everything else as well. Most of the time the solution to a problem isn't something you can look up, or sometimes is known outright. If everyone had to solve problems that already had a solution, we'd be going nowhere, and fast. No matter if it's code or hoppers or circuits or lighting, Olin's filled with these challenges, and it can be frustrating. But it's the kind of frustration that's motivating, not defeating. It makes you want to work harder to fix the problems, and when everything clicks and works, it's great.\u000a\u000aBut I'm getting lost again. The play! Working on lighting for FWOP (Franklin W. Olin Players) was challenging, but now with showtime in less then 24 hours I'm giddy for everyone to see all the hard work all the crew and cast had put in, as well as for everyone to see everything (geddit? Sorry, it's 2 AM). Of course, all the hard work the primarily freshman cast and all the crew put in also means late night sessions trying to get all the work that's piling up done.\u000a\u000a\u000aLeft to Right: Philip ('13), Molly ('13), Myles ('16), and Ilana ('13) all working on various work after a long FWOP Rehersal\u000a\u000aIt's a practical problem. One that I just love tackling. Just not when I'm ready to sleep.\u000a\u000aPeace! But not, literally.\u000a\u000a-W\u000a

aV\u000aThis upcoming weekend is a big one: Commencement and then move-out. Over the past few days, I've been wrapping things up for sophomore year. To be honest, this year was a rough one for me, but its ending is still bittersweet. While there has been stress, sickness, and all sorts of craziness, the time has still been flying by. Within a few days, I will be halfway done with my undergraduate career.\u000aHow has the end been?\u000a\u000a         It was a frantic finish, with UOCD (User Oriented Collaborative Design) dominating the lives of all of the sophomores. The night before the final design review, we ended up using class funds to order pizza for the students working late into the night.\u000a\u000aPeople ran out, and the pizza was gone almost immediately.\u000a I was sort of impressed at the speed, though some people were less than pleased that they didn't get as much.\u000aOnce that late night was over, we could all breathe a bit better. While there were still many papers to edit, finals to study for, and projects to finish, one class was down. UOCD was by far the heaviest course I had this semester, though not necessarily the most difficult. I very much enjoyed this class- though I often wished it didn't result in so many late nights.\u000aIn any case, UOCD was nice in that the final design review was before the finals period, giving more time for preparing for other classes. During this time I had to run around preparing for next semester as well. This is one of the more sad parts of the end of the year- seeing my room get more and more empty and sterile, realizing that I won't see many people for at least 7 months, if not much more.\u000aIn the end, though, the sadness means that new things are also coming. Next semester I will be in (and blogging from!) Florence, Italy, where I will be attending an art program. For a semester I will escape the late nights crunching numbers, trading them in for late nights steaming hats and painting portraits.\u000aBefore that, however, I'll be writing during the summer as we transition to some new bloggers, including (eventually) some of the class of 2012. Talk to you later, all.\u000a-Jessi\u000a

aV\u000aIt's been a busy couple of weekends as Candidates flood the campus with their excitement and curiosity. I won't lie... having more people over has been lots of fun but has also made my life undeniably busy. The first Candidates' Weekend I had more time to spend with people but with each progressive weekend more work hits me. Unfortunately for you Candidates who are coming this weekend, this means I only have a limited time to spend with you. Don't worry, though! I'm sure you will still have an exciting time with other Oliners (who perhaps have less work)who continue to carve out time to find out how cool you guys are. \u000aBut this post is not really about Candidates' Weekend( I just felt the need for a little tangent). As the beginning of the last Candidates' Weekend draws near, I would like to take a moment to reflect a little bit about life during the week at Olin. Can you believe it's only a month since Winter Break ended and I've already(as per Olin norm) managed to overschedule myself?\u000aThat being said, this time around, it only took a couple weeks for me to wisen up and drop the activities I'm less passionate about in favor of more sleep and well... general health and sanity. With the brutal murder of pass no record, I feel the need to be more awake to efficiently tackle my work.\u000aThis unfortunately does mean I've dropped Baja Racing, and that Blues Dancing has become the occasional treat, time permitting. But prioritizing has allowed me to take some time to relax. (Dare I say it?)\u000aYou see, dear reader, I have something to confess. I- I've fallen in love with ice skating.*cues blushing* I've always loved to relax rollerblading but due to the copious amounts of snow/ice/wind...and well general New England winter I can't. Also the draw of free admission to Babson/Olin students was too much for me to resist.\u000aI think I've skated over 9hrs in the last 2 weeks...which I realize is an extreme amount. But I find it extremely cathartic. It's a step toward me learning how to care for myself mentally without the help of anyone else. You see, what I've found at Olin is that it's easier to get all your work done than it is to remember to take care of yourself and your mental sanity.\u000aSo I've been trying to remember to cut myself some slack. The other day( the Thursday we had off because of Candidates' Weekend), I took a day to just breathe. I slept, re-read Ender's Game (which is a brilliant book that you must read if you haven't...even if the author was a terrible person) and watched all the hulu episodes of shows I could. I guess what I'm trying to say is don't forget to take a break, fall behind momentarily, and take care of yourself. I promise it will help you be more productive in the long run.\u000aJuanita Desouza\u000a'17\u000a\u000aP.S I think ice skating will be my passionate pursuit this semester. I've already bought skates and used them over 5 times.\u000aP.P.S Here's a video of my current favorite skater. \u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmqZ7mRgkvU\u000a \u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a   \u000a

aV\u000aI have never attended a large school; I graduated with 74, and now my class at Olin is just barely bigger than that. Not only that, but my job the last two summers has been with a company with 9 employees. My hometown has a population of just under 8,000, and Needham's not really much better with its 29,000 (thanks, Wikipedia).\u000aEven with all of this, though, I was shocked when I found out today that my study abroad program has less than 30 students enrolled. I knew it was on the smaller side, but 30? This set off an explosion of nerves.\u000a        \u000aWill I make friends? Sure, I was totally pumped to hopefully not hang out with Americans the whole time, but honestly, my Italian is still in the "I can tell you I'm hungry" stages. Not the best basis for a friendship. Even at Olin, I came in knowing people, having met them at Candidates' Weekend. This time, I'll find out my roommates a week before I leave, and I'll get my class schedule when I arrive. There's no planning, there's just doing. Plus, for the life of me I can't remember what I put for the neatmessy scale on the roommate form and this frightens me greatly.\u000aCan I manage in a foreign country? I've gotten better at managing money, thanks to some near-scares with my bank account this summer. This is a whole new place, though. I'm not used to having to think about locks, thieves, and losing my passport. I mean, maybe Boston driving is a little bit European in terms of anger and recklessness, but I don't think that I've quite graduated to being ready.\u000aWhat will happen if I am as terrible at packing as I usually am? I am *terrible* at packing. Just plain awful. I overpack to no tomorrow, but then I'll forget pajamas and a hairbrush. I don't know how I'm going to pack for the next few months, with no quick drive home to get everything I forgot. I need documents, adapters, clothes for changing seasons... Plus, I have to deal with the fact that after Dec. 19th, I'll be lugging everything I have with me around various countries in Europe.\u000aWhat if I don't get into Hat Making? This would be by far the most tragic of all. In all seriousness, I really want my schedule to work out correctly. Granted, I love almost every kind of art there is, but I've become really attached to the classes I put down as my first choice. Hopefully with so few students they won't resort to cutting an unpopular class. I don't know how these things work.\u000aUsually I'm better than this- but this is making me wonder if maybe that was only because moving to college was moving 20 minutes away. I'm sure I'll make it, in the end, but for now I'm playing what-if scenarios over and over in my head. Luckily (or unluckily- why am I so terrible at packing?), I don't have too long left. I have 6 days left of work, then I move out of my apartment (I will miss JP and the delicious City Feed sandwiches), go to California to visit another Oliner for a week, frantically pack for a week, and arrive in Zurich and then Florence on September 1st.\u000aI guess I'll just have to remember to breathe.\u000a-Jessi\u000a

aV\u000aAbout two months ago, I turned twenty. The small existential crisis that followed got me thinking: What does it mean to be an adult? Frankly, I have no idea. But what I do know is that an adult who has no desire to play in a ball pit is hardly an adult worth becoming.\u000a\u000aA bit about myself: I am the proud owner of three onesies, a horse head mask, and a squeaky rubber chicken. The last two movies I watched were Disney movies, and I have an intense love for Adventure Time. My Principles of Engineering project was born of a team love for Harry Potter. At twenty years old, I went trick-or-treating in a nearby neighborhood on Halloween. My roommate (Anne LoVerso '17) and I have covered our room with an absurd amount of posters, and on Friday nights, we host Rock Band while our neighbors (s/o to Michael Sheets '17) serve waffles shaped like Mickey Mouse. Perhaps the most important of these things, however, is that about a month ago, Anne and I impulsively purchased 1600 plastic balls so that we could have a ball pit in our room.\u000aNew Olin PR photo?\u000aSome people might consider these things childish, and maybe they are. But these are the things that make me happy. Should being an adult mean giving up the things that make you happy just because they might be "childish"? Well, I suppose I can't tell you how to live your life. But I know where I stand.\u000a\u000aTake a moment out of your day to embrace your inner child.\u000aHaley '17\u000a

aV\u000aThis past Monday was Expo day. For me, a lowly freshman, this was significant in a few ways: one, it was, of course, going to be my first Expo, and I didn't reallyknow what to expect; and two, it was going to be the first time I would leave Olin for more than a week. Because my dad would be coming up for Expo, I was going to be leaving that day. I wasn't going to have time afterward to hang out with my friends. Thus, I vowed to get relatively little sleep so that I could make the best of the time I had left.\u000a\u000aSo the night before, what started as a midnight birthday dance party in the West Hall antilounge slowly morphed into an enormous blues dance party. Many of us were already regular dancers; others had never danced a day in their lives.\u000a\u000aBefore we knew it, it was 3:00 in the morning, and the music was still playing. I wandered off and wound up watching a movie with the few hours I had left until morning. Finally, at quarter after 5, it was bedtime.\u000a\u000aThree hours later, I had to wake up. My Expo schedule was going to be jam-packed: at 8:30, before Expo even started, I would have rehearsal and sound check for ORO, the Olin Rock Orchestra. This would go right up until ORO's performance at 10. After ORO, I would have to run over to the academic center to rehearse for the WiReD Event (basically a performance of the compositions that my music class had created over the last month). The WiReD rehearsal would run right up until noon, when the actual performance was. Right when the performance ended, at 1, I would have to run to a different corner of the academic center in order to present my Modeling and Simulation project. Finally, after my project presentation, I would have to run to Milas Hall for the Olin Conductorless Orchestra's rehearsal and subsequent performance. When OCO was through performing, Expo would be over.\u000a\u000aIn other words, I was busy for the next six-and-a-half hours.\u000a\u000aOn three hours' sleep.\u000a\u000aGreat planning, Greg.\u000a\u000aFortunately, the first hour turned out to be the hardest. Once I found a few minutes to run to the dining hall and shove some cereal in my mouth, I was awake enough for the rest of the day. I even managed to talk my WiReD professor into letting me run over to the dining hall for ten minutes to grab some lunch. Despite my poor sleeping habits, Expo ran very smoothly overall. Our performances went phenomenally (for the most part), and people seemed generally interested in my ModSim presentation - or if not, they were pretty good at faking it. At 3:00, though, I was ready to just sit down.\u000a\u000aMy dad advised me that we would either have to leave before 4:30 or after 6:30 to avoid traffic. Because I hadn't yet packed my bags, I told him it would have to be after 6:30. (Besides that, I wanted extra time to say my goodbyes.) I spent the next fair while packing, until it was finally dinnertime, and then time to go.\u000a\u000aDinner took a fair while, due to a combination of the facts that it always does when I'm not in a rush, and that I was sort of trying to delay my departure. Eventually, though, my time came. I had to file out. When I stood up to leave, the twenty-odd people at my table all crowded around me, and I spent the next several minutes hugging each and every one of them goodbye.\u000a\u000aAfter an absurdly long time, I was gone. I treated myself to a nap in the car. After all, it was an exhausting day.\u000a

aV\u000aUh oh. My calendar informs me that there are only 12 days until the end of classes and about 3 weeks until all of my projects are due. That also means about 3 weeks until I am half-way through my time at Olin. Not really sure which of those is scarier.\u000a\u000a\u000aSERV's annual Kickball event. Good excuse to lie around outside.\u000a\u000aIt's definitely a light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel moment considering how challenging this semester has been, but it's also quite alarming since we have barely started out Stuff of History project, still have a chapter of German to cover, need to take all of the data we've collected in DICIEO and turn it into something useful, and finish designing the product we will be proposing in UOCD.\u000aBut on the plus side, the third Stuff of History project is extremely flexible in terms of what we can make as a deliverable, so we will be making a silent-film style slide show using photos we make ourselves. These will be done on an Ernest Shackleton-era Kodak camera, a color Polaroid camera, and a modern camera phone. The slideshow will explain the relationship between technological advances in film photography and how photography's role in society has grown over time.\u000a\u000aWe got this on eBay for $40. And you can still buy film for it. Can you believe that!?\u000a\u000aIn DICIEO, it is very challenging to try and figure out how to conveythe giant pile of sticky-notesall the data we've collected, but doodling node-and-edge diagrams that could put this information on our website is just awesome. Talking about work we will do in the class next semester is even cooler when you wrote the course description (andbasicallythe syllabus) for the course.\u000a\u000aUOCD has been a struggle all semester, but we're within days of having everything come together in a solid product-model that is able to do things that verge on the magical, but in a way that clearly speaks to values and areas of opportunities within our user group. All we have to do is make the visuals to tell that story well.\u000a\u000aAnd German, like any language, builds on everything that has come before, so one more chapter won't be that bad.\u000a\u000aSo even though the weather is gorgeous, the end of the year is within sight, and the desire for summer break is higher than ever, we're almost there. And now that room-draw (yay living withKevinagain!) and course registration is all over, there's a fantastic new semester to look forward to on the horizon...\u000a\u000aDinner on the balcony, always a nice way to end the day.\u000a\u000a

aV\u000a        I finally had a chance to feel culturally significant among my rather well-traveled friends here when, after a massive shopping trip at the store a mile away and approximately 14 hours of cooking, Thanksgiving came to Leeds!\u000aGenerally, I'm the token American in a gaggle of Aussies (with a couple Germans and a Frenchman thrown in for good measure). It was exciting to be able to share something from my home and background. Mom was instrumental in food preparation; she got up at 4:00am on Wednesday to give me family recipes and cooking tips over Skype. Now that's love.\u000aThe product of the Skype chat - scribbled recipes and ingredient lists (with metric conversions on measurements) \u000a\u000a        Thankfully, English Christmas meals share many components of American Thanksgiving meals. The grocery store just stocked whole turkeys, aluminum aluminium baking pans, and imported cranberries (from North America, of course). I was particularly worried about the cranberries, as the sauce is one of my favorite dishes. I've spent the past 21 Thanksgivings in the Midwest, often driving past Ocean Spray bogs, so they're a given. Easy to find. Fresh. Plentiful. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, cranberries are getting more popular in Europe, so Wisconsin exports quite a bit over here. It's a good thing, too, since even with this boom, the tiny containers of the fruit went for about $5 a pop.\u000aAnother reason to be thankful: Michael ('13) came to visit this week, and helped me lug everything back to the flat. Plus, he came with a suitcase that was perfect for Tom (our turkey). Fun fact: Tom weighed 5.26 kilograms. I've never seen a turkey weighed in metric units before. It's not right.\u000aMost of the supplies, back in the flat\u000aCooking commenced shortly after supplies were acquired, and continued into the night. Just another tradition to uphold.On Thanksgiving day, friends came over to help set up, and we had construction paper waiting. Here's the real cultural part.\u000aEmbracing the tradition\u000aInevitably, the hand turkey exercise turned into a contest. I was shocked to see how quickly my friends jumped into this tradition; everybody waited for the scissors rather impatiently, eager to add a new feature to their own creation. These works of art included flames, teeth, princess crowns -- the works.\u000aFinished creations, put on the bulletin board in our kitchen\u000aOf course, this was also a stall tactic. Tom needed to sit for a while. (Turkey fun fact #2, courtesy of Wikipedia: When Europeans first encountered turkeys on the American continent, they incorrectly identified the birds as a type of guineafowl. Guineafowl were also known as turkey fowl because they were imported to Central Europe through Turkey.)\u000aNow, the thing that makes me most thankful of all: EVERYTHING WORKED. I couldn't believe that I (or the St. Mark's kitchen) was capable of producing a passable Thanksgiving meal without ruining any of the dishes. But it happened. Here's the proof:\u000aEveryone gathered round for their first Thanksgiving\u000a\u000a\u000aWe had turkey, mashed potatoes, apple sauce, Irish stuffing, green bean casserole, maple cranberry sauce, and caramel apple pies for dessert. One of my favorite comments of the night came from a friend after taking a bite of pie: "You made this?"\u000aThough it was my very first Thanksgiving away from home (and Mom's cooking), it still felt right. The smells and flavors were there, the Packers won (11-0 this season!), and the St. Mark's clan made for a fantastic substitute family, perfectly dysfunctional.\u000a

aV\u000aIn my last post, I left off with a bit of a cliffhanger. Why, you might've asked, was my hair so strangely colored? Even if I didn't explain it then, the picture served a purpose. The mother of the very first candidate I really talked to, Dan, had read my entry about it and asked if I was one of the student bloggers. Her recognition took me a bit by surprise, but it was really cool to actually connect with a reader.Now that it's out there, though, I think that it's time to explain why my new nicknames are "Skittles" and "Rainbow-head." Here at Olin, we have something called the SERV Auction. Every year members of the Olin community put services, goods, and other things up for bid in either the silent or live auction. Unsure of what to donate, I went with the safe baked good route, then added a painting. Finally I decided to put something strange up for bid: my hair. The winners, who ended up being three of my friends, had full control over the color of my hair. This wasn't the weirdest item, but it certainly is one of the most obvious.\u000aIs this typical? Maybe not. What it does relate to, though, is the Olin student's creativity in the way of having fun. I was doing my Software Design lab last night when one of my friends, Mike, came in to show me his newest creation. Mike recently purchased a bass guitar and needed a quiet amp to practice. Rather than buy something big and expensive, Mike picked up Make Magazine and built one using some Radioshack parts, a Ritz cracker box, and an op-amp. The results are impressive.\u000a\u000a\u000aIt makes me really happy when my classmates just do weird things for fun. At Olin, it's probably one of the few things that comes close to "typical."\u000aI think this is all for today- next week I'll probably talk about my CW adventures. I loved meeting you all last weekend, and can't wait until Friday to meet the next batch!\u000a

aV\u000aLet me start by giving you some numbers:\u000a25 days2000 mi round trip4 countries28 hours of racing4 laps of the Nrburgring3 automotive pilgrimages7 GB of data consumedOver 2000 photos saved (probably over 7000 taken) And a map*:\u000a\u000a*Not an exact copy of our route, but it was easier to just let Google go where it wanted...\u000aThat's the statistical analysis of my European Extravaganza, but how about a narrative version?\u000a\u000a suppose the story starts part-way through this past semester when I turned 21, and was coming to the end of a rough couple of semesters. That and the fact that this is probably my last chance for a full-blown summer vacation prompted the family to agree that a "summer trip to end all summer trips" would be a nice way to celebrate my 21st and my father's 50th (a couple of years ago) and recover from the stresses of an intense academic year.\u000aBefore my overseas adventure could begin though, I spent a week at Olin to help out with the I2E2 Summer Institute. Sebastian was there, and sometimes Asa, too. It was an incredible experience getting to spend a week with such a spectacularly diverse group of visiting educators (and a week with some awesome Olin faculty, too). As usual, Seb and I were surprised at just how many people come from overseas to get a taste of Olin, compared to virtually no US educators. Goes to show the state of US education I suppose. \u000aSeb, Lynn, and I plotting...something.\u000a\u000aThis was the largest attendance I2E2 has dealt with for the Summer Institute, so it's only fair to congratulate Sharon Breitbart and Lynn Stein for managing to keep everyone more-or-less happy. I have no doubts that this program will continue to grow and achieve, so hopefully there will be room for some student helpers in years to come.\u000aAnd of course it was nice to be at Olin outside of the stressful semester schedule. Getting to hang out with people and not worry about homework or exams or design reviews was brilliant. Alas, I only had one week to enjoy it before the big adventure began.\u000aWell, almost began. Before starting my travelog, I should admit to being very lucky to have never really suffered at the hands of the airline industry in terms of missed flights, lost luggage, etc. I arrived at Logan with plenty of time before my flight to London. So that's my responsibility for getting to Paris taken care of. We boarded and taxied out to the runway more or less on time.....until someone discovered that apparently there was a discrepancy in some paperwork and nobody knew exactly how much luggage the luggage in the hold weighed. So we were obliged to turn around, taxi back to the gate, and wait an hour for some people to weigh some bags. Besides the obvious boredom and frustration this caused to all, I was getting a little concerned that my 90 minute layover in London was rapidly evaporating.\u000aOh well, we got going an hour late, but trans-Atlantic flights always burn a little extra fuel to make up time, especially since the Gulf Stream is with us. Right?\u000aScenery trying to make up for being late...\u000aNope.\u000aWe arrived in London 90 minutes late, giving me approximately a 0 minute layover. Oops. It shouldn't have been too bad though, since the delay was long enough that British Airways had had time to re-book everyone, but that included the people on the late flight from Hong Kong, too. Of course, with this sudden influx of late people and the need to change terminals and the perpetual issue of airports being designed in the least-helpful ways possible, I ended up missing the check-in for my new flight. Oh the irony.\u000aAll was not lost, however, as very nice BA clerk got me re-re-booked with a 2.5 hour layover, so no worries about missing that connection, and plenty of time to get some much-needed refreshment. Of course, lunch would have been great at this point, but when you only have 10 in cash and you need most of that for the Paris train from the airport to the hotel, suddenly airports seem outrageously expensive. I can now confidently report that it is possible to live off of one cup of coffee when traveling internationally and being stuck in an airport for several hours.\u000aMaaaaany hours after I had planned to arrive in Paris, I finally walked out of Charles de Gaulle - bags and all - in search of a train. I even found the correct train to Gare du Nord easily and was soon reacquainted with my mom (who had taken the Eurostar from London after spending a week in England with my grandmother) and my dad (who flew in from Phoenix), after we all arrived at our destination hotel within a couple of hours of each other. FINALLY the adventure can begin...\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a\u000a george's blog post preview\u000a\u000aWelcome Class of 2013!  I'm probably the tenth person (if not more) who has enthusiastically said this to you today!\u000a\u000aWell, assuming you made it there, what with the cancellations of flights due to tropical storm Danny, parents getting screwed by the rental car company, sudden emotional crises, chance jackelope encounters, or what have you.  Don't worry if you haven't made it to the gates, past the softball field, and to the blue-and-silver balloon festooned Campus Center cafeteria.  I was 5 hours late to the first day, and I turned out alright; really all you "lose" is the half of the room that can't be seen from the door (which is always coveted, unless you and your roommate are really tight and rearrange your room so you both get the good side).  But seriously, I hope you've gotten to school alive and well, gotten the big half of the room (unless you're in 224 where both halves of the room are uncomfortably shaped), and are now enjoying one of the three times in the year that the dining hall goes all-out with the fancy dishes and tablecloths.\u000aAnyways, we're really excited to have you around (myself especially, since I didn't even get a chance to see you at CW last year), and we hope you're doing well.  But, as excited as you are right now, we don't want you to fall into the trap of sitting in the lounges, playing Apples to Apples nonstop because you think there's nothing else to do (I have a card dedicated to me in one of the decks, with some very racy alt-text to boot!), and hounding the one guy you know who brought a computer to get a sweet, sweet, 5 minutes of email.  So, the Olin bloggers have gone ahead and compiled a list of things you might like to do during orientation.  Hit the jump for suggestions.\u000a\u000a  You don't even have to leave to have fun - check out the contents of cabinets in the halls, something they're filled with surprising things\u000a\u000a  Try finding the acoustic locus of the EH lounges\u000a\u000a  Do the same for the O\u000a\u000a  Find sweet places to play sardines - 3rd floor AC and some areas in the OC..ahem, Milas Hall, are pretty good for this.\u000a\u000a  Try to get from the entrance to WH to the fourth floor lounge without touching the ground.\u000a\u000a  Check out the bike and unicycle room - the bikes with green tape are GO bikes, which you can borrow for your own needs.  Lock 'em, and try not to trash them, since I'm one of the dudes that repair them, and would be really sad if I came back to a wad of bike repairs.  Great, now you're mobile!\u000a\u000a	Visit the Wellesley dump.  Wellesleyans toss the best stuff - cabinet speakers, bikes, books on pipe flow dynamics, bicycles, $16K of gold coins in a water cooler, etc...\u000a\u000a	Find the giant gaping hole in the Rugby field, enter, and run along the Wellesley Aqueduct trail: map\u000a\u000a	Visit Needham and find useful locations: Harvey's Hardware, Bank of America, Sudbury Farms, Trader Joes, 7-11\u000a\u000a  check out the public libraries in both Needham and Wellesley while you're there - they have an unexpectedly good selection of non-technical books and DVDs.  Of course, the Olin library and stacks have a great selection of technical stuff - check out the take a boo, give a book shelf, the sci-fi section, the magazines in the stacks, and the instructables.  Have a pizza party at midnight while you're there - you're allowed to (thanks honor code!).  Ask for specialties like the Alex Davis or the CCCP if you call the Dominos at Wellesley - they are both traditional Olin novelty pizzas.\u000a\u000a Go back to the 7-11 after your pizza party and get a slurpee.  It is hard to go through Olin without doing a midnight Slurpee run, so you might as well make your first one fun.  For extra points, get the most ridiculous snacks you can and leave them as an offering at your favorite R2's door (I recommend my R2 this year, Traz).\u000a\u000a  For that matter, just get a lot of snacks wherever you can, in general.  When you're actively meeting people at Olin, snacks are essentially money.\u000a\u000a If you get snacks at a grocery store, get cooking supplies, and use WH kitchen while it's still clean (better yet, keep it clean, maybe leave a nice note the the kitchen committee for their work on making a new WH kitchen)\u000a\u000a Grill something in the grills - I'm currently craving rosemary-crusted salmon with a garlic lemon baste, plank grilled, but this man offers a different suggestion\u000a\u000a	Take your picnic over to the Foundry porch (more adventurous souls can try to break into the foundry and watering Colin's tree - he'll tell you where it is)\u000a\u000a Go over to Wellesley town and find Lemon or Amarin Thai, or try the Sweet Basil/Not Your Average Joe's scene in Needham\u000a\u000a	Cycle over to Wellesley College and find the Wang Student Center and Clapp Library - check out the bubble tea stand in the Wang - it is pretty ok tea.\u000a\u000a Cycle back to Wellesley College at midnight and experience the fog on the lake, the backyard of the dorm complex by the lake (it's a really big lawn going into a forest, you can't miss it if you take the forst trail from the lake to the Wang), the trail through the bog behind the Wang, the waterfall, and the track - all of these look really eerie and attractive at night.\u000a\u000a Cycle down to the Commuter Rail in Needham, and get a ride for you and your bike into Boston.  Woah!  You're in Boston!  With a bike!  The obvious place for celebration is the MIT Anna's, Mike's/Modern Pastry in the North End, or the Boloco on Newbury street (where there is OMG shopping as well.)\u000a\u000a find the swing, the two cars, the barn, and other treasures in parcel B.  Don't look for the secret hiding places - they obviously don't exist\u000a\u000a Babson students sometimes have entrepreneurial ideas for what are essentially perpetual motion machines - do what you will with that information.\u000a\u000a While you're doing what you will, stop by the pottery studio, where Stephanie Osser will be so excited to see more Olin people.  She loves Olin people coming over to make creative pottery and will immediately find somethign fun for you to do while you listen to the CD player that skips because clay dust has made the disc reader kind of glitchy.\u000a\u000a  Also check out the smoothies place at Babson.  Laugh at the umlaut, and maybe get a smoothie.  Reflect to a kinder time when we got free credits for smoothies on our meal plans (2010 was the last year to experience that, but we will never forget, maybe).\u000a\u000a Find the Olin Bridge (I have no idea what this is but Angela appends this suggestion with a mysterious "hahaha...", so it must be good)\u000a\u000a hold a croquet tournament between the dorms\u000a\u000a Get a tan while you still can (bonus points for listening to the song "Daylight", and trying to replicate Kim's ridiculous grin)\u000a\u000a Take a shower, try to figure out how to make the most of your water pressure\u000a\u000a Call your Mom and Dad a few times before you get too busy to remember\u000a\u000a try not to overdose on soft-serve ice cream (or any other dining hall food), however if you do decide to form a cult following for any food, Guava-Orange-Passionfruit juice nectar beverage liquid is where it's at. \u000aBest of luck, and a very wet welcome to you!\u000a-The Olin Bloggers and friends.\u000aP.S.  Anyone have other suggestions/stories? \u000a\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHere's a list of things about senior year that I am so excited for (sorry, no pics, but I'll post some as things happen in the year!):\u000a\u000aLiving in a hallway with a bunch of my friends. One of the dorms, East Hall, is structured such that there are suites of 6 individual rooms with 2 bathrooms and a common room. We formed a hallway of 18 of us, and I can't wait to see them and decorate!\u000aApplying for jobs. I think most people would say I'm crazy for thinking that's something to look forward to, but I'm excited to find out where in the world I will be in the next year!\u000aSCOPE! I cannot wait to see what team I am on, and who I will be spending all day Wednesdays with.\u000aMeeting the class of 2017. New faces are the best!\u000aBeing a CORe rep! My class voted me into office as a class representative for our student government. I'm excited to plan fun shenanigans, represent my class, and help change the school with the other members of CORe.\u000aGraduation. Okay, honestly, I'm half looking forward to this one. Since Olin has such a small, tight-knit community, we like to do our graduation a little differently. Everyone gets to pick 15 words that are read by a speaker as they walk across the stage. You can find some here from the class of 2013's commencement. I'm so excited to see what my friends' words are (and think of my own!)\u000aOlin. As you may have read, Olin's notorious for 'the bubble,' and after chatting with some Alums, the social life of Olin is quite unique. I'm definitely looking forward to this, though I think I may miss it the most.\u000a\u000a\u000aOther Olin students, what are you looking forward to about the academic year? Did I forget something important? Tweet me your response, and I'll edit this post (@jordyn_olin14)!\u000a

aV\u000aHey there, readers!\u000aI managed to forget June existed on the blogging front, but that doesn't\u000amean I wasn't up to cool shenanigans! This is my quick attempt at filling you in\u000aon my summer internship, as well as a small list of reasons as to why everyone\u000ashould try to spend some time in the summer in Milwaukee. I will apologize up\u000afront for the lack of pictures in this post-I'm not allowed to take any\u000apictures at work, but if you could see the sweet workstation at my cubicle...\u000a\u000aHow Olin has prepared me for my summer internship:\u000aWith four weeks left in my summer internship, I figure\u000anow's a great time to start reflecting! This summer, I've been working at GE\u000aHealthcare in Waukesha, Wisconsin, with my fellow blogger, Brittany. This\u000aprogram is strongly tied to the post-college rotational program, which you can\u000aread abouthere. I hadn't been to\u000aWisconsin before May, let alone spent more than a week in the Midwest at the\u000aage of seven. The lifestyle here is very different, and everyone's super friendly.\u000aAs Alex ('15) likes to say, the Midwest has swept me off my feet.\u000aAs you may have read before, my major is technically\u000aengineering with biomechanics. Whenever\u000aI tell this to people, they either ask me what that means, or assume\u000aprosthetics. To be honest, I don't know what my major means to me yet; that's\u000awhy I left it so open-ended; however, I did create my major with the intent of\u000abeing able to learn a large variety of things; breadth rather than depth, if\u000ayou will. This summer has been much more electrical/computer based than my\u000aprevious summer/major may seem. I've\u000aspent quite a few hours [read: most of my time] using MATLAB, learning about\u000aimage processing algorithms, and taking data on XRAY systems. I can say this\u000awith complete certainty: if Olin hadn't exposed me to MATLAB in excess my first\u000ayear, I would not feel nearly as comfortable in the position I am in.\u000aYou've all read it, heard it, or seen it: fact is, Olin\u000acan be a very much hands-on environment. This is great for taking data on\u000amachines [which is awesome, by the way], and creating a plan of action for\u000asolving a problem. The very first day of work, when I was given my main\u000aproject, I broke out some sticky notes, and attempted to identify assumptions I\u000awould need to make when working on my project.\u000aAfter a week of working, turns out I had way overspecced the\u000aproject. I think the fact that I\u000aover-prepared myself for the problem I faced is a direct reflection of Olin's\u000acreation of great problem-solvers. I\u000aalso feel fortunate that my communication and "people" skills are\u000astrong because of the structure of many of my Olin courses, as well as the leadership\u000aroles I fill while at school. I also feel\u000afairly confident as a female engineer in the industry, which is something I am\u000aoften nervous about.\u000aOn Milwaukee:\u000aThis city is AMAZING! I highly encourage you [whoever may\u000abe reading this] to spend a summer here. There are actually quite a few companies\u000abased in the area, with large summer internship programs, and there have been\u000aothers here at said other companies [hint, apply!]. I'm living with three other GE Healthcare interns: one each from University of Florida, Bucknell, and UC Berkeley! It's been a great way for me to branch outside of the Olin bubble.\u000a\u000aThis city ALWAYS has something happening every weekend.\u000aThere is normally a cultural fest each weekend [the picture above is from Polish fest],\u000abut one of the highlights for me, the music-crazy kid, was summerfest, an\u000a11-day music festival that brings in all sorts of amazing artists. I was able\u000ato see more than ten of my favorites for relatively cheap, some of which are shown in the collage below. I saw Rascal Flatts, Fun, Trampled By Turtles, Imagine Dragons, Motion City Soundtrack, Death Cab for Cutie, and many others! There's also the fact that we're right by Lake Michigan, which is quite pretty, and Chicago, where I'm headed in a few\u000aweeks!\u000a\u000aIf you're in the area, make sure to come to the summer\u000aparty in a week and a half! I'm excited for my first summer party not in my\u000ahome state, although I will miss my Floridians.\u000aWith all of that said, I cannot wait to be back\u000aat Olin. I've been getting exponentially more excited for my third year, for\u000athe classes, and to be back with everyone I call my Olin family. Thanks to\u000agoogle plus for letting me see many of their faces at once =]. I'll try to post more about my summer soon!\u000a\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aHello again! It's almost Thanksgiving break! Woot. This also means that there's approximately a month left in the semester - what?! \u000aThe thoughts spinning through everyone's minds are about how they're going to complete their semester final projects. I love how Olin students are fueled by a passion to build and make their projects work well rather than worry about numeric grades. This means we often have a healthy mix of both exams/problem sets to worry about and subsystems of a project to spice up the queue of assignments. Whee! \u000aRecently this week, nearly everyone I know has been overwhelmed by midterms (it's not even the middle of the semester! Why is this vector calculus test called a midterm? Regardless, that was a fun experience, especially with the group oral exam. Thanks Linearity!) and intermediate project deliverables this week (These are slightly more fun - they involve lasers, tinkering, and 3D modeling, not necessarily in that order). \u000aSpeaking of projects, today my entrepreneurship class team installed a bed in the dining hall to advertise our BedDesk - a swivel desk which attaches to the frame of your dorm bed to improve your study/relax experience above your mattress.\u000a\u000aGrace Ahn ('2016) giving a sales pitch for the BedDesk, a swivel desk which attaches to your dorm bed frame! (project for The Entrepreneurial Initiative)\u000aSpeaking of Thanksgiving, what are your plans for the break? The possibilities range from staying on campus for an Olin Thanksgiving celebration, roadtripping throughout mountains, or flying back to the west coast to spend time with your family/local friends for the week.\u000aAs for me, I'm super excited to escape the Olin bubble for a week. I'm from the Bay Area but have the lovely opportunity to adventure with one of my best friends to Maryland.Sometimes in a campus in as small and quirky as Olin, it's helpful to have a breath of fresh air to appreciate it fully - there have definitely been a few times when the Olin bubble effect has been overwhelming and stressful, in both social and academic ways. Olin is definitely still a home outside of home for me, but I need to get away for a while. This semester has been rough in its own ways.\u000aSpeaking of off-campus adventures, there are plenty of ways to pop the Olin bubble even if only temporarily - these include transportations such as vehicles, hovercraft scooters, cars... and of course, the GO Bikes! GO stands for Greening Olin, and is the organization responsible for the communal bike share program at Olin.\u000a\u000aOur beloved corner for the Olin student communal bike share program. Behold, the fleet of GO bikes!\u000aThis semester Jennfier Anderson '16 (also an OLINsider blogger!) and me have begun revamping the GO bike program. This included repairing the bikes from last year, adding some new bikes to our fleet, and improving the bike space for Olin students. Our most recent pursuit was implementing a training program for students - bikes are a communal resource and users must be aware of how to use them safely, just like the power tools in the machine shop.\u000aWe're also planning on organizing bike repair workshops for students interested in learning more about bike repairs and tinkering - mostly on basic yet fundamental bike repair techniques like replacing/patching flat tires, brake systems, truing wheels, chains, and all that jazz. Stay tuned for more GO bike updates this school year!\u000a

aV\u000aOlin students get very excited about things very fast. Our community service organization, SeRV, had been talking to students about a charity event hosted by Vecna Technologies, a robotics and technology company in Cambridge. Vecna was hosting a fundraiser involving a robot race and a 5K (human) run. SeRV offered funding to those who wanted to participate in the robot race. As many of you may have seen from a number of my previous blog posts, I love Doctor Who. So my ears immediately perked up when a friend suggested that we build K-9, the Doctor's robot dog companion from the 51st century. With this project coming in on top of a middle-of-semester 20 credit workload, I was immediately nervous. I didn't feel that I had the time to do the things that I wanted to do near the end. But I was motivated to make this project succeed, because I wanted to build K9. After a slow start, spring break, and a bit too many long nights for comfort, we finally managed to scrap together a rideable, talking K9 with only 4 students and a $200 budget.\u000aThe base frame of K9\u000aI'm not going to go into too many specifics on how we actually did it, because I'm still trying to process it. We found two humongous wheelchair motors, laser cut a bunch of scrap wood, and threw together a bunch of different sensors and systems to make our electrical system. Strapping that all together, we had a robot.\u000aDavid Elkan ('15), Mitch Cieminski ('16), Celina Bekins ('17), and myself\u000aThe day of the competition made it all worth it. After so many long hours working on it, we were finally at the end, and even though not everything ended up working the way we wanted to, we met our design goals. Number one: It looked like K9. Number two: It could complete the race. Number three: it was rideable. The best part was, by bringing it to a public event, we were able to validate our success and the work we put into it. Not only was our robot a robot, like any of the others at the Robot Race, but it was K9! A stream of parents who watched Doctor Who when they were younger insisted they get pictures of their children riding our robot. Even people who weren't fans of Doctor Who loved what we did, because our robot had character, which made it loads of fun. Multiple media outlets came and talked to us about what inspired us to participate. "We really just wanted to build K9" was the usual response.\u000aK9 during the race, being ridden by Celina Bekins ('17)\u000aI am addicted to projects. If I am inspired, I will start a project surrounding my inspiration. There are lots of awesome things that happen here, just because students get inspired to do fun things.If someone mentions something interesting to me, I will be dying to help them. It's a big problem, because I know sometimes that I can't take on all the things that I want to do.If Oliners don't have the time to do something they are passionate about, then they will physically make that time available, and that's exactly what I did. What comes out of that time is amazing, but it definitely comes with a cost. I definitely got less sleep that I've wanted to, but I know that I've made something really cool.Taking on this project was definitely pushing my time and stress limit this semester, but it was definitely worth it, because I now have a new pet robotic dog in my room, and I've made one more thing that has made me feel like I've accomplished something awesome.\u000aAlex\u000a\u000a

aVOlins size does some funny things to the school. There are the obvious things  the student/faculty ratio, limited social circle, etc., and there are the quirks you dont quite notice til you get here. The quirk that Ive been experiencing lately has to do with extracurriculars.
p583
aVMost Oliners have some serious hobbies. Passions outside of engineering are encouraged by the Admission office when you apply and are then fostered on campus, so most people have something else, an art or a sport or awhatever category fire-spinning fits into. The fact that Olin is densely populated with other interests allows everyone to have a full college experience, even in a school with ~350 people.
p584
aVHowever
p585
aVClubs dont scale very well. In my theatre troupe in high school, we had roughly 100 people and 8 student board members. Here at Olin, the theatre troupe, the Franklin W. Olin Players (FWOP), has no more than 20 people and5 board members. I only just started Linearity I, but Im pretty sure that isnt a linear system. The crazy part is, FWOP NEEDS all its board members, just as much as my high school needed its board members.
p586
aVThe point Im trying to make is that in order to sustain the clubs that sustain the passions that sustain the Olin students, those students end up in way more leadership positions than they would in any normal-sized college. Many people are in two or three.

aVThe leadership gap at Olin is so great that there is a phenomenon of upperclassmen not only scrambling to get freshmen to join their clubs, but to put them in charge; and not just in Freshmen Rep sorts of designated, first-year only positions. Not to knock those jobswe had two great representatives to our Student Government, CORe, last semesteruntil one of them was made Vice President of Finance, anyway. Which is totally typical: a freshman gets involved with an on-campus organization, and is immediately sucked up into a leadership position, whether the organization is student government or a theatre troupe.
p588
aVWhich is to say  I am technical director of FWOP now. Thats where all of this is coming from. On the one hand, its a fantastic opportunity for me to showcase my skills and make a difference to the Olin community. On the other, Im freaking out a little bit. This never would have been possible at a larger school and I totally wasnt expecting it. Will my designs be good enough? Will I have enough time to lead effectively with all of my classwork? Will I be able to manage an organizations budget and the time of those depending on me? And above all, will people respect me as a leader if Im just a freshman?
p589
aVThe short answer is, yes. The long answer isthere are no freshmen at Olin. Seriouslyas an institution, weve switched over to calling them first-years. Because we arent fresh (we arent all men either, but that kinda goes without saying). We all have tons of experience, either from our lives before Olin or our classes in our first two semesters. The upperclassmen need us, and even better, they trust us. All we need to do to lead is trust ourselves.

aVP.S. A huge congrats to everyone who just heard they were invited to a Candidates Weekend! All of us at Olin cant wait to meet you! For those of you at CW2, youll be on campus at just the right time to see FWOPs Twelfth Night  come say hi, and see for yourself if I do a good job after all!

aV\u000aI'm sitting in my room, supposed to be preparing for class (sorry, ProbStat), but I've got something on my mind.\u000aSomehow, we have arrived at Candidates' Weekend I. It begins today. Not next week. Today.\u000aThere has been A LOT of preparation all over campus, and it's exciting to once again see it all happen.\u000aSome things that have been going on/will be happening all too soon:\u000aDesign build preparation - My classmates have put together an AWESOME challenge for candidates to tackle with their teams. (Too bad I can't tell you anything about it.) But, not to worry; this exercise will not be evaluated.\u000aThe Tempest - The Franklin W. Olin Players (FWOP) have been rehearsing endlessly in preparation for performances over the first two Candidates' Weekends.\u000aICCA - Powerchords (our most well-established a capella group) are competing in a super cool intercollegiate competition this weekend. Wish them luck!\u000aInterviewer training - Olin students are given the opportunity to interview the candidates and find out more about them as individuals and team players. I'll be seeing some of you later. :)\u000aPseudo Club Fair - Engineering Discovery will be putting on a bit of a show along with other clubs, such as Baja, Human Powered Vehicle, Butterfingers Juggling, and many more about which I am forgetting because I'm rather distracted.\u000aFire - Olin Fire Arts Club has been burning like mad to make sure their show is thrilling.\u000aDorm visits - Candidates get to hang out with us in our "homes" after the fire arts show. This year, I live on a floor open to visits. I've decided to embrace it as an opportunity to clean up my room... (Mom, if you're reading, I promise it's not that bad)\u000aCandidates:\u000aRelax and have some fun. No, this is not a trap. We like you much better when you're being yourself.\u000aSleep before Saturday. Sleeeeeep.\u000aWake up to some good music on Saturday morning (While I got ready for the day two years ago, I made it through the entire Feed the Animals (Girl Talk) album).\u000aTalk with current Oliners. Make sure you find people with different opinions. Ask us what we dislike about the school.\u000aWhen you're here, look for the girl with purple (well, closer to pink now, thanks to hard water) hair, whimsical shirts, and a permanent smirk. Also, be sure to visit my room! We have comfy chairs and (probably) good food. My roommate likes to bake.\u000aI'm looking forward to meeting all of you! Safe travels and best of luck.-Brittany\u000aOther exciting things to tell you about later:\u000aMy first trip out of the country, wherein Nathaniel (of Nate and Luke fame) attempts to bribe a federal agent\u000aVisiting the Museum of Science planetarium before it opened to the public\u000aEngineering Discovery insanity\u000aUser Oriented Collaborative Design - I'm working with a team of fellow 2013ers (including Ais) to find the needs of people with body modifications (tattoos and piercings).\u000aGoing to the Packers v. Patriots game a while ago. And the wise subway operator we met on the way back to Olin.\u000aThe Packers are the 2011 NFL Champions! For the first time since 1997!\u000a

aV\u000aHi again everyone,\u000aTechnically, I'm not supposed to post on the same topic more than once, but  I figured this was worth it, since people seem very interested.  My apologies in advance, because I think this is going to be a very long post!\u000aDay 1 (Saturday, December 1):  It begins\u000aThis day started very early (6:45 AM), especially bad since I didn't finish printing my poster until 1AM that morning, and didn't fall asleep until at least 2:30.  We were into our hotel by around 11 after having taken a shuttle from the airport, but I did not manage to get a nap in before it was time to head to the Washington Convention Center.  Unfortunately, they are very strict about not allowing us to take pictures, so I can't post any here from the actual conference.  After figuring out where we needed to put up our posters and getting some food, it was time for the poster session.\u000a        This session was actually a ton of fun.  For the most part, it was only undergraduate students (since it was the Undergraduate Session), but there was at least one person I saw who was not an undergraduate student, but said that she purposely signed up for the session in order to meet undergraduates this year, so she was awesome to talk to.I spent the first forty five or so minutes walking around other posters, and it was amazing to see how many different topics before.  There weren't that many repeats that I noticed, and no one was studying the same tumor suppressor protein (RASSF1A) as Karen and I have been.\u000aAfter this, we headed out to the keynote symposium, with the theme "New Biologists for the New Biology".  After a very long introduction, the first speaker, William Bialek of Princeton University took the stage with his talk entitled "The Other Half of Western Civilization: An Experiment in Freshman Science Teaching".  This was actually a very interesting talk to go to, being an Olin student.  He was is actually a physicist, and was talking about the need for more integration in the world.  He talked of biologists as an example of people who traditionally study in a more qualitative manner, and physicists as a representative group of people who generally study a more qualitative, mathematically intense set of courses.  And, it turns out, that he sees the need for biologists to be more quantitative and physicists to be more qualitative, and is doing something about it. At Princeton, he has been behind a new program that teaches first years who choose to participate and have appropriate previous experience (they require Calc BC) an integrated course that combines physics and chemistry, and then a follow up course of biology sophomore year that relates to the first course.  In addition, they stress hands on problem solving, and even require students to use MATLAB.  Currently, this program is a little younger than Olin, in that its first students are, I believe juniors this year.  I am not absolutely positive on this though.  As I said, it was a lot of fun to listen to this talk.\u000aThe second keynote speaker was Shirley Ann Jackson, the current president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. She is actually also a physicist, and spent four years as the chair of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Her talk was entitled "Discovery, Innovation, and Policy in Human Health."  While more wide-reaching, her talk was also very interesting, and she addressed the need for more interdisciplinary approaches to science and engineering teaching.  With this idea, she provided many great examples of innovations and research going on at Rensselaer that support this need for integration.\u000aDay 2 (Sunday, December 2): Recovery\u000aOn the second day of our trip, weather was not fantastic, which, I guess is to be expected in December.  (How did it get to be December already?!).  I'm not going to lie to myself and say it was only the weather, but we were so tired that we stayed inside all day.  Not much to report, but lots of movies were watched, and appropriate rest was achieved.\u000aDay 3 (Monday, December 3):  Sight Seeing and Fun\u000aFor the third day or our trip, we decided that we had to get out and actually do something.  Having never been to D.C. before, I really wanted to get some sight seeing done.  We ended up seeing the Washington Monument, World War II monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and all those buildings.  This was all well and good, but it was ridiculously windy which was making everything fairly cold, so we decided to spend the last hour we had free for sight-seeing inside the Smithsonian.  With so many museums to choose from and so little time, we settled on the Natural History museum because I really wanted to see the Hope Diamond.\u000a\u000aHere's a picture of me at the Washington Monument.\u000aAfter, this, we made a mad dash to the hotel and grabbed our poster, which needed to be up that evening for our presentations the next day.  After putting up our posters, Karen and I decided to try to find whichever mini symposium Sadie and Joanne were in, listen, and then try to catch up with them afterward.  The symposium we ended up sitting in was actually to help people navigate a program for searching a gene database that we used in Joanne's Biology class, so that was interesting.  Then, we went out to dinner with Joanne and one of her friends and a really delicious Italian restaurant.  That was very interesting, and we got to talk about what it is like to research in a laboratories and deal in office politics.\u000aDay 4 (Tuesday, December 4):  Last Presentation and Flight Home\u000aWaking up on Tuesday, we were facing another long day.  After getting ready and checking out of the hotel, we headed over to the Convention center for our last round of presentations.  While Karen was presenting in the first session, I tried to walk around and visit some posters, and get some work done because of all the time I was missing at Olin.  Then came my poster session, which went pretty well.  I had an interesting time talking to various professionals, including some in different fields of study.  In addition, we had the privilege of meeting a parent of an Olin student, and getting visited by Timothy Smith who had been interning in D.C. this semester.  And then, just like that, the conference was over.  We headed to the airport and, after a couple hours worth of delays and problems transferring airlines, we were finally back and ready to hit the ground running at Olin for the final stretch.\u000aBest wishes,\u000aJessie\u000a

Honestly, that should always be your number 1 priority. If you need sleep, get sleep, no matter what is due tomorrow.\u000aDon't procrastinate. That is the biggest enemy of number 1. I'm not going to say that I've never started a paper on the day before it was due, but even then you start it at 9 in the morning, not 9 at night. That's an extra 12 hours of work time.\u000aTake breaks. You really can't do a solid 8 hours of work and still feel good about it. Taking breaks also helps you reboot your concentration.\u000aMake time for yourself. Do something that relaxes you. Honestly, I like organizing my room to de-stress. Or running around playing Frisbee. Whatever works for you.\u000aSmile. Laugh. It really helps (see science).\u000aDon't worry about everything all at once. It really helps to concentrate on going through things systematically. I have a list I write down every day of what I need to do, and just check them off as I get them done (what can I say, I'm old fashioned--still using paper lists)\u000aDon't sweat the little stuff. Really, no one cares if the color schemes of the lines of your graphs are coordinated. Just let Matlab decide and go. You will still get an A if you did the project as well as I know you did.\u000aGo outside. Do things. Whether "outside" for you just means outside your dorm room, or if it means take a trip into town or whatever.\u000aBe nice. Nice to your classmates, nice to your professors, nice to everybody you do things with. It feels good, and it will help them to like you back. +1 to Social Life.\u000aHave FUN! As much as possible, do things that you find fun and interesting. It will keep you motivated and you'll have a better time overall.\u000a\u000aObviously, all of these are just my opinion, but they've seemed to serve me well enough through three years of college so far.

aV\u000aSo it turns out that the end of term crunch is not isolated to just American education. Here I am, with one day of exams left, still up past midnight, cramming to make sure I know everything and anything that might come up on my exam. Here in London, exams are 100% of the grade.\u000aI haven't mentioned much, if any, of my academic experiences overseas at UCL yet on this blog. They're different, and not just because I'm not taking any engineering courses. My three economics courses and one geography course are all 200 person, twice a week hour long lectures. They have no graded assignments, aside from a four-times a term "tutorial", where attendance is taken and missing more then one class means automatic failure. While the material has been fascinating, the lecturers are dry and the class the opposite of interactive. This is in contrast to economics courses I took cross-registered at Wellesley in preparation for study abroad (You knew that right? Olin students can take one course a semester at each Wellesely, Babson, and Brandies University). At Wellesley, I was in a room of 30, having constant professor to student interactions discussing and reinforcing the material, which combined with bi-weekly group problem sets, meant I really learned my material. Here, at UCL, the goal is that the student spends considerable time outside of class reading on the subject matter, self-learning important applications and specifics.\u000aI'll be honest, I prefer the American way better. I miss Olin's group work, as intense and crazy as it gets come the last few weeks. I miss small(er) class sizes ("er", because Olin's class sizes aren't always as small as one might presume - an increase in faculty is much needed and discussed), and most of all, interactivity. Alas, I'll be back at Olin soon - I leave London in five short days. \u000a

aV\u000a        I'm taking 4 classes this semester: Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship, Renewable Energy, Intro to Moral Philosophy (at Wellesley), and the Art of Approximation, or since that's surely far too many syllables for a name, "Approx".\u000aApprox is real-world, back-of-the-envelope type math (our professor sometimes calls it "Street-Fighting Math". We cover questions like "What's the bandwidth of a 747 packed with CDs flying from Boston to London?", thinking on a logarithmic number line, and converting 7/16's to decimal without a caluculator. The class is way more than just numbers-we also talk a lot about creating mental models and how to handle data.\u000aOur class made this numberline to collect and compare information we find ourselves using frequently.As we spend so much time in the logarithmic world, one of my favorite tricks we've learned so far is this method for converting to base 10. It's based on pianos, and the assumption that 2^10 (1024), is basically 10^3 (1000). Here's how it works:\u000a\u000a        Some preliminary math:\u000aEach octave on a piano is a doubling of requency: to the C above middle is at twice as high a frequency as Middle C. The intermediary notes between C's are equally spaced (by frequency), and, counting both white and black keys, there are are 12 of them: 12 halfsteps or semitones = 2X frequency. Also, there's a 3:2 frequency ratio between G and C which are separated by 7 semitones. With those two starting points, we can figure out how many semitones it takes to make any desired frequency ratio.Getting this chart takes a bit of creativity. For example, we know that a 3-fold increase in frequency is 19 semitones,because 2(3/2)=3 -- so we add the 12 semitones to the 7 semitones to get 19. The trick is in remembering that the semitones are equally distributed but are already on a multiplicative scale. 2*2=4; or 12+12=24 semitones, and so forth. 2*3 = 6, so 6X frequency is 12+19=31 semitones and so forth. 7 requires a bit of fudging, so we saved it for last and simply placed it between 6 and 8. We're going to use this chart to write an exponential number in terms of semitones, and then convert it to factors of 10, or any other base we want. \u000aNow with all that background, let's try an example:We know that each factor of 4 is 24 semitones, so we have 13x24=312 semitones. 40 semitones is a factor of 10, so we can say that 312 semitones is ~7.8 factors of 10.I know 10^7.8 is something a bit larger than 6 X 10^7, 60+million*. For reference 4^13 is actually 67,108,864. Pretty good!\u000a*Because I know that 10^0.8 is 6.something. It's useful to have a couple known conversion points out of the logarithmic scale: the easiest and most useful to remember are probably that 10^0.5 ~3 and 10^0.7 ~ 5.\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVThe best day of my winter break started surprisingly early--7 am, which I'm pretty sure isn't actually supposed to happen on vacations.  Vivian ('09) and I stumbled out of her house before her mother even woke up (I was staying with her family for a week), and headed straight for our all-time favorite breakfast joint: Jamba Juice.  There's really nothing like a fresh fruit smoothie on a California morning.\u000a        
p611
aVWe pulled up in front of Will's ('09) house close to ten minutes late (sometimes there's traffic in the morning--surprise!), feeling guilty for our tardiness.  Luckily we weren't the only ones running a bit late--only Morgan (the golden retriever) awaited us impatiently.  We settled down at the kitchen table to finish our delicious morning treats, lolling uselessly while Will's parents packed up the van and Will fed a very eager Morgan.

aVSomething about piling into the back of a minivan with a bunch of my friends makes me feel like a little kid going to the park to play (especially with parents in the front--even if they were Will's parents, and not my own).  But this day held something much better than the park in store for us.  We drove north to San Francisco, getting off the freeway briefly to pick up two more passengers: Dave and Russell ('09).  Will called them every few minutes as we neared; we finally picked them up on a sidewalk near Golden Gate Park.  I didn't realize how much I had missed them--we had only been separated for about a month--until Dave and I were hugging, and then jumping up and down in excitement.

aVAfter what seemed like hours of anticipation in the car (but was probably more like, oh, 45 minutes), we arrived at Ceja Vineyards.  We were greeted by the owner's loquacious son, who went by his nickname, "Fregone."  (He told us his real name, too, but I don't remember it.)  He led us through a very enjoyable and down-to-earth wine tasting, poking fun at wine critics the whole time.

p632
aVWill's parents dropped us off at a Safeway near San Francisco's famous Castro district.  Dave promised it was only "a few" blocks from his boyfriend Dan's apartment (which was our next destination); he needed to pick up some vegetables for the evening's dinner party.  Will and I supplemented Dave's healthy choices (bell peppers, mushrooms, onions) with wine, vodka, and the most flamboyant pack of sprinkles I could find.  (Vivian and I had baked some chocolate Guinness cupcakes with cream cheese frosting the previous evening.  Dan had teased me via e-mail, and the only threat I could come up with in return was that his cupcake would be "very, er, special.")
p633
aVThen we began the hike.
p634
aVIt took us several blocks to even reach the Castro--several blocks of pharmacies, thrift stores, and homeless men.  I knew we were (finally) getting close when I noticed a man who looked better in skinny jeans than I could ever hope to.  When we reached the Castro, it became abruptly obvious why Russell referred to San Francisco as "the Mecca."  Even the Bank of America had rainbow flags in its windows.
p635
aVWe weaved down Castro Street, past countless restaurants and bars, and finally turned off, walking past the Harvey Milk Civil Rights Academy and up the hill to Dan's apartment building.  Up one long flight of stairs and around the kitchen, I found myself squealing and hugging Michael ('09) who had just gotten in on a flight from Seattle, and then Dan himself.
p636
aVDan had done his part to prepare the apartment, it seemed, which was very clean, and also sported a table covered in bottles--alcohol, juice, and soda of all varieties.  Dave ignored it and quickly set to work washing and chopping and seasoning.  I decorated Dan's cupcake.  It didn't take too long, though, and I was soon slicing bell peppers and chopping onions.
p637
aVWhen Russell finished his famous spinach and artichoke dip, though, I snuck away from the kitchen, following the dip surreptitiously into the living room.  I proceeded to completely spoil my appetite, but I felt no remorse.  It was delicious.  I asked Russell what was in it, and he simply responded, "You don't want to know.  Trust me."

aVAt some point, dinner was served, and I transitioned from the spinach and artichoke dip into the dining room for an equally-delicious baked ziti made with vodka sauce (my favorite).

aVWe suddenly realized the late hour, and set Will and his iPhone on the task of discovering the Caltrain's departure times.  There was one departing in a half an hour, and another departing at midnight.  My desire to get to bed before 2 am won out over my desire to stay, drink, chat, and eat more, and out we waddled.   Down the stairs, down the hill, back through the (by this hour, quite bustling) Castro, and into the metro station.
p647
aVA stranger noticed Vivian's cupcake carrier, which still had a few cupcakes left (it is a colossal tribute to Russell and Dave's cooking skills that any were left at all).  He commented on it curiously, and we offered him a cupcake.  He accepted it, hesitating slightly when we mentioned it had been made with Guinness.  He took a bite, however, and proceeded to make a few delighted "mmm" noises, and to expound on its delicacy once he had swallowed.  Vivian was flattered.  I was just astounded that a stranger would accept and eat homemade food, in a subway station no less.  I suppose Vivian and I don't look like the poisoning types.
p648
aVWe boarded the next subway bound for the Caltrain station.  Will was agitated, by which I mean he checked the time on his iPhone, counted the stops on the subway map, and told us simply that we "might have to run."  I twitched impatiently the whole way there, but we boarded the train with three minutes to spare without breaking into a run once.

The Bakayamas are just little hills on the lawn outside the main academic building on ICU's campus. We wore masks and did a dance with just the newcomers, and then a dance with the whole dorm.

aVI'm in the front row, second from left, holding the big white mask that's meant to be a kodama, a forest spirit from Princess Mononoke.
p665
aVAnd yesterday, we finished our second performance- for an event called "Engeikai." For engeikai, all newcomers (freshman and exchange students) have to act and/or dance in a play that the sophomores write. I'm still not totally sure what ours was about, because the Japanese was a little bit above my level, and the characters all spoke very fast in high pitched voices, which made it even harder to understand.
p666
aVI do know the characters were based on the children's show Anpanman, which is about a superhero made of anpan, a bread filled with sweet red beans. For reference, this is Anpanman.
p667
aVAnyway, we practiced A LOT- we had a nearly 10 hour engeikai practice on Sunday alone (I was there for maybe 6 hours - I had a really small part, but still had to be there for forever). I was irritated, to be honest, but it's how it is here. There's quite a bit of pressure to make this kind of event absolutely spectacular. My dorm in particular is really intense about it; they've apparently had the best play every year for about 8 years running.
p668
aVIt was a very uniquely Japanese experience though, and kind of cool in that regard. We all wore crazy costumes and TONS of makeup- kind of based on traditional makeup, with very white faces and exaggerated colors. But it ended up getting pretty ridiculous. Like, I had the word "god" written in huge letters on my forehead in liquid eyeliner. 
p669
aVThere were four of us (who had very minor roles) that had either "god" or "kami" (Japanese gods/spirits) written on our faces. I don't actually know if that was relevant to the story or not, but here's a picture.

aVI'm on the far right. We were all supposed to be wearing white dresses, but I didn't have one, so I improvised. And then we all ended up performing in togas.
p672
aVAnd here's the whole cast!

aV\u000aSpring has Sprung\u000aSomething has changed around Olin's campus. Instead of it being completely silent, with only a few heavily-clothed students rushing between the dorms and the Campus Center, it appears that people have actually started to venture back outside!\u000aHallelujah! The snow has melted, I can see the beginnings of green on the trees and in the grass, the thermometer on my window currently reads 75.7 and I can go outside and sit on the great lawn without a coat on!\u000aThis, of course, means the annual Olin tradition of "moving the entire 1st floor lounge onto the Great Lawn" will shortly begin again:\u000a\u000aHey, we're engineers. Of course we can take 5 sofas outside, and set up a way that all of our computers can still be plugged in while we enjoy the wonderful sunshine. Obviously.\u000aHowever, along with the warming weather and increasing temperatures also comes the dreaded increase in workload--and a score of other shenanigans. Final projects are beginning to be assigned in all classes, and particularly us sophomores are realizing how very little time we have left to finish our UOCD designs. Eeek.\u000aOn top of that, the dreaded room draw begins next week. Zach Holmes wrote a brilliant article about this particular event in the school newspaper Frankly Speaking (http://franklyspeakingnews.com/), which I invite everyone to read. I feel it completely necessary to insert a personal anecdote here: the biggest problem I have with room draw this year is that everyone seems to think that the 1st floor of West Hall is a crummy place to be. As someone who lives here, I must just quickly insert the fact that it is quite lovely--it is not nearly as cold or dark as people seem to believe.\u000aAnd, finally, with the end of the year comes the knowledge that next year is starting far too soon. Registration for next years' classes is coming up shortly, which just adds another set of stresses, especially for 2nd draw rising sophomores (that was me last year: you pretty much cross your fingers and hope that people don't take your spot).\u000aBut, it is important to remember with all of these class and school-related stresses that the outside world is now open again for people to enjoy it. If your matlab code is simply being MADE OF TERRIBLE, take a break. Go outside and enjoy the multitude of small birds that have taken up residence between the dorms. Remember that sunlight is, in fact, a thing--there is not just light from computer screens. And everything will hopefully be working when you go back to it again. And hey, the arrival of spring means that summer vacation isn't too far away!\u000aHappy Spring Everyone!\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aI'm going to start off this post by highlighting the most important difference between me and the many snow-ridden posts before me: It's summer here! We went to the beach last weekend!\u000a\u000aI'm checking in from the sunny So Paulo, Brazil. In case you missed my last post, I'm here with four other Olin students, taking a leave of absence to work at a university called Insper to help develop their new engineering school.\u000aOur job here is multi-faceted: we act as harbingers of Olin's culture, and figure out how to adjust it to improve it for a new iteration, but also to make it fit within Insper's constraints. For example, we're acting as NINJAs in several of the first-semester courses that have just started. But NINJAing here is very different from at Olin, and not just because of the language barrier. Insper students don't live at school - every evening they go home to their family or to their apartment. However, at Olin, one of the ways NINJAs are different from, say, TAs, is that the NINJAs are your peers. The great thing about them is that they can be a close friend, or even someone that you help in a different class. They live in the same buildings as you, and they're available late at night when the professors aren't, and you can talk to them when you need to.\u000aSo it's a difficult challenge to figure out how we can preserve the informal peer teaching aspect of NINJAing in the new environment here. And the coolest part is, we'll be working on that, improving our roles as NINJAs, and hopefully creating an environment that will facilitate learning and peer teaching even after we leave in June.\u000aBesides NINJAing, we're working alongside the professors to develop curricula for the coming semesters. This is an exciting job that involves prototyping labs and lesson plans to see how everything connects. Insper's courses are a little more overlapping than those at Olin. For example, the ModSim that's running this first semester will be different from Olin's version, because at Insper, ModSim won't teach coding. Students will learn Python programming in their Software Design class, and then will use that knowledge to implement their ModSim models. It's less modular, because each course has to work for the whole curriculum to work, but with more space for underlying themes to tie all the classes together in a semester.\u000aOverall, we're here to figure out what parts of Olin we can bring to Insper, what parts can be changed, and even what parts of Insper we can bring back to Olin. It's already a busy schedule, and then you throw in learning Portuguese, taking a business class, social events, exploring the city, trips, and more - we have a busy life! But it's a refreshing break from classes that allows me to be a little more introspective into my own education and what changes I can make when I return to Olin.\u000a

aV\u000aAugust is fast approaching, and, for many of us, those summer opportunities that we've covered fairly extensively are coming to a close. Unfortunately, that means the paycheck goes, too.\u000aSo. What about working during the school year?\u000aPart-time employment is not uncommon, either on campus or off.  (This is especially true if you are willing to make websites for Babson students*.) The specifics vary, but if it's cold hard cash you're after, a part-time job can be had -- and, in my opinion, to no particular academic or social detriment.\u000aWe engineering types often like to talk about trade-offs. I discuss my own experiences balancing Olin and a side job, after the jump.\u000a\u000a         On-campus jobs typically have a handful of perks: flexible hours, consistently awesome employers, and zero travel time, so they fit pretty well into even the busiest of schedules. (Olin pays a reasonable hourly wage based on class year.)\u000aI found that my few hours on student payroll were great for funding my social expenses, but last year, I was also looking to save up for a semester abroad. Working off-campus - I ended up at a local restaurant - offered a higher wage, though it certainly cut into my free time. I was duly concerned that my life would degenerate into nothing but work, but hey, money can be a powerful motivator.\u000aOn academics. Squeezing in project meetings can be tough. I found I had to be pretty upfront about my outside commitments - and even with compromises all around, we'd often end up starting around a non-ideal 10:30 pm. (Bring snacks.) On the upside, we were more efficient with the time constraints. (This principle seemed to apply to problem sets, too.)\u000aAll work no play? Absolutely not. There are some sacrifices: time spent lounging on the Great Lawn gets cut short, I catch only the end of what was probably a good movie, and I miss some impromptu dinners out. (I am always woefully behind on campus gossip.)\u000aSo, yes, some day-to-day spontaneity is lost - but forward planning is easy enough, and I got out plenty. (Not having to balk at the cost of a ski trip? Yes, please!) Campus events are typically promoted enough in advance that they can be scheduled around, and parties don't really kick up until long after the latest shift ends.\u000aSome extra perks. Getting out of the Olin bubble is a big plus. My job provided a regular break from engineering, and I actually found the change in scenery a little stress-relieving. (And since I ate for free on the job, I could get the spicy food the dining hall doesn't provide!)\u000aA lot of the experience, of course, varies with individual personality, motivations, actual job descriptions, and so on. I certainly can't tell you what you should and shouldn't do, but I can say that the part-time job is still a viable option at Olin. (For what it's worth, I have every intention of picking both my jobs back up once I return in January.)\u000aAnd with that, if you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments. I'll do my best to answer them.\u000a- Andrea, '11\u000ap.s. The future will hold plenty of opportunities to post pretty pictures, talk about my upcoming life in Lyngby-Taarbaek, and other such things. Please forgive this giant block of text!\u000a* I kid. Sometimes, we just like to give our neighbors a hard time.\u000a

aVMy name is Kendall and I'm spending this semester in Rabat, Morocco studying Standard Arabic and North African migration. I live in the old medina in Rabat with a Moroccan family. I'm eating a lot of Moroccan food, practicing three foreign languages on a regular basis, and traveling around Morocco. My semester has been incredibly busy and also wonderfully rewarding so far, and it's only been a handful of weeks!

aVMorocco is an especially interesting place to live at this time because it gives me as close a view as is safely possible of the continued political unrest known as the Arab Spring. Being able to see for myself, not only the protests themselves, but the reaction of my Moroccan family and their coverage on both Moroccan state news and news stations based elsewhere in the Arab world is a priceless perspective. In addition, I'm able to see first-hand what it's like to live in a country and an area where it is not unusual for men to stay out late in cafs but women are expected to stay at home, religion is a public affair shared by nearly every citizen, privacy is a serious matter but personal space is a foreign concept, and not only is there a king, but he serves as both a spiritual and political leader. This semester will be no four month vacation. Morocco is many things but it is not a post-card perfect country. Rabat has beautiful architecture, but trash everywhere. The cafs are lovely and serve wonderful coffee and juice, but they are often inhabited solely by men. Moroccans have a deservedly famous reputation for hospitality, but street harassment I have experienced is constant, unending, frequently entertaining but often exhausting and sometimes downright insulting and invasive.

aVMorocco is wildly different from home and only three weeks is not enough to see even the tiniest fraction of it all or even begin to understand the complexities of the politics, culture, and people. I look forward to continuing the adventure.

aV\u000aI'll just come right out and say that this post is going to be very subtly related to Olin. But the subtly Olin theme holds an importance which I daresay amounts to fundamental in this radical new school we've got going here.\u000aWhat I'm talking about is Carpe Diem. I'll leave the introduction to the more ritualistic aspects of the idea to professor Rob Martello, local champion of Carpe. Chances are you've heard this common Latin phrase before. "Seize the day," it tells us. Plenty of gag variations exist out there too- frankly I'm not that interested in them. Fully ignoring any of this dilution by overuse, the soul of Carpe Diem lives at Olin. What is Carpe Diem? It's the get up and go, the throw yourself at something new, the "Sometimes you just gotta do something," * "live life to the fullest" ** attitude. Don't wait, live today. That's what I'm talking about.\u000aNow on to my tale of St. Patty's day last.\u000a        \u000aFriday morning, I sat in my swivelly desk chair perusing the CORe Digest, weekly publication speaking of wondrous upcoming events and tidbits of info, news flashes from off-campus and on. I think my favorite part of this particular digest was the calendar for the next week: Only the words "spring" and "break" for the next 8 days. Ah, how I crave the precious downtime, the change of pace, the lack of incoming assignments and delay of due dates... But something caught my eye. A very short advertisement: "Student Work at Family Party." Idly curious, I scrolled to the brief description. \u000a\u000aTwo students needed to help at family party on Saturday evening, March 17th, in Needham. 7:30 to 12:30, 10$/hr + tip.  Please call (ph #)\u000aYou know, I don't have any plans for this Saturday, this 2nd night of spring break.  And now that I think about it, I haven't had a positive cash flow for months. (Although some Olin students maintain on or off campus jobs, I've never found the time- there are too many extra-curriculars I can't live without.) And you know, I really like meeting people, random people even. Who knows who I might meet at a St. Patrick's Day party in Olin's home town? It would be lots of fun spend a night having that ever-common conversation along the lines of "Olin? I think I've heard of that... Really exciting new school right? Yeah. What's it like there?"  Yeah, I think I could dig working a party for my evening's entertainment.\u000aSo I called. But before I did, I needed an accomplice. Someone equally adept at conversationalizing with strangers. Someone who enjoys putting in some effort to help someone out, someone who understands that the effort will probably pay off in the advertised "+tip." Possibly even someone I've traveled with and who has spent lots of time side-by-side with me, washing dishes.  2 calls later, I had my friend. The infamous " Jef One F "- fit the bill to a "T", or in this case to a single f. Jef was in. So I called the party hosts, with all their party-assistance needs ready to put on the bargaining table. They were delighted to hear a response, and that was that. "See you tomorrow at 7:30." And off we went.\u000aThis party far exceeded my expectations. First off, you had to admire these folks for their Irish authenticity. They were for real- they were the kind of Irish that keep the shamrock dish towels out all the time. Their walls were painted green. They were seriously Irish- and serious about hosting a sweet party for family, friends, and neighbors. And Jef One F and I were there to make it run smooth, keep the dishes clean, the trash picked up, the delicious food passing from hand to mouth, and of course the beer and wine glasses full for many a merry making guest.\u000aFrankly, we were overachievers.  The two of us would circle the spacious lower level of this elegant old suburban domicile, eyes darting from counter to table to mantlepiece searching for an abandoned mug, a forgotten soup bowl, a disheveled napkin. We probably startled the first few guests with our eagerness to take their coats, wanting to feel useful. But we took ample time to relax as well, introducing our selves and our background to the many aunts, uncles, children, and neighbors of our hosts. The whole crowd was bedecked in their St. Patty's green- from sublty mint-striped dress shirts to full plaid kilts. The party-goers were mellow, as assured us by our hosts. They ate well, and drank better. Two musicians arrived and played Celtic folk tunes on the fiddle and guitar. The lot of us sang and clapped and stomped along. I let myself linger between drying bowls and emptying trash to watch the fiddler swing his torso side to side. His hips, though planted in his seat, seemed not to inhibit the dancing of his upper half. The party swayed and coursed and swelled to merry fullness, lasting a solid 5 hours.\u000aTwas the height of all festivity, and at the end, Jef One F and I made our last push to tidy all the dishes and wipe the counters and clear the massing bottles and beercaps and leftover soda bread and Irish stew and the remnants of the most apply apple crisp I've ever tasted. Our hosts took pity on our meager college student diet and pushed tupperware after tupperware of their delectable leftovers towards us. We thanked our new friends as they thanked us, over and over until it was silly. They recommended us to host-hopeful neighbors, and perhaps we may start a racket in this borough for our 2-man party clean up service. They pushed payment into our palms, and bid us goodnight.\u000aWe left beaming, befriended, our job well done and our customers very satisfied. Social skills and wallets bolstered, we trundled off into the night in my beat up pickup. A right cheery St. Patty's it was that night, and we never for a second questioned our decision to spend our night at someone else's party, lending a hand.\u000aHenceforth, when I hear opportunity in the wind, or hear a muttered "carpe...", or Jef One F turns to me and says "Double Bennett, Let's make this happen,"  I'll  remember this Saturdy the 17th of March: a day well seized.\u000a*, **:  Thanks to Ben Salinas and Ana Karimi for their responses to my question:\u000a\u000a"One sentence or less: What does Carpe Diem mean to you?"\u000aI'll welcome your responses below.\u000a

aV\u000aWell, with everyone else posting, I guess I'd better jump on that bandwagon before it tries to ford a river and our oxen die.\u000aThis summer has been amazing. I'm actually living in the dorms for 10 weeks and commuting to Gloucester, MA (pronounced Glah-stah). Part of me is screaming "Get away from Olin! You were here all of last year. It's like you can't let go!" and the other part counters "But why would I want to be anywhere else?" In general it was an interesting decision to make between the super sweet internship and spending this summer with my family. I chose the internship because I wanted a job where my mad-Olin-skillz could find a home, and not just another sales job, but I still feel like I've betrayed my mom or sister in someway. Maybe it's just part of this college-to-adult transition, or maybe I should get those voices checked out. I can't imagine they're healthy.\u000aOtherwise, I am having a blast! Let's make a list of what I'm doing and how amazing it is.\u000aWorking a 40 hour week: Yea, it's pretty sweet. My internship roxors, too. I'm working for Varian Semiconductor in their software division. This company builds ion implanters (machines that take a charged particle, filter out all other particles, and implant it on a silicon wafer with exacting precision) and my team is trying to write a software simulator of their latest model. This simulator will allow our software people to test the control software on their computers instead of having to use one of the actual machines. Anyway, I'm the systems engineer, so it's my job to figure out how the darned thing works, understand all the physics that happening, and then make recommendations to my team on how to code it. It's teh hotness. Of course, my commute is 1 hour there and 1.5 hours back, which is killer. With my mpg, that's $20 a day. But the internship is well worth it.\u000aCooking for myself: Gasp! and I thought laundry was rough. Now I'm forced to prepare my own meals. Well, the first shocker was food. Yea, that's right, grocery shopping every week. The moniez, the time, and the consequences for not doing so were all shocking. Thankfully, I found a group of guys to make a cooking co-op with me. We each cook dinner once every four days. This way I don't have to worry about making dinner every night after work (that would be hard) and I can just worry about planning less than 2 meals a week. It's great.\u000aVisiting Peoplez Everywhere: Right, we have somewhere around 40 students staying at Olin this summer, and maybe another 40 living in and around the Boston area (either as permanent residents or just renting a house or apartment over the summer). Just last weekend I visited my good friend Evan Morikawa (he's the kid with the glove) who is renting a house in Cambridge with two other Olin students and doing research in astronomy with Harvard. My friend Pam, who lives up in Dracut, came with me. The three of us first looked at pictures from the 3.5 weeks he spent in Europe with Christina, his girlfriend, then walked around Boston. First we fed ducks in Boston Common (technically, Boston Public Gardens), then walked to the Prudential Center, walked around the mall, and ate dinner at the Cheesecake Factory (that was our weekly splurge. We can't really afford that all the time). Finally, we went back to Evan's house to watch Caddy Shack because Pam was going to start her Caddying job the next day.\u000aAnyway, I'm doing this kind of thing left and right. There's a get together every Friday in Somerville that I usually stop by, and today I'm going up to Pam's with a few friend to celebrate the 4th. It's really really really cool to have all these Olin kids around when I'm restricted to only 40 hours a week. One of the things people love about Olin is the people, and I can now finally enjoy them.\u000aE-Board: Yea, so student government doesn't rest over the summer. We're having a meeting tomorrow over AIM and I have to read the Annual Review before that. I've also been in touch with Wellesley (I'm the ambassador from Olin to Wellesley), but haven't made much progress on the front. But yea, I have plenty to fill my time, and, to counter the indomitable Jessi Murray, I do wonder if Olin students ever rest. I think the difference is that during the off season, we just do other things, but with the same intensity and schedule.\u000aAnyway, I can't wait for the class of 2011 to get here. I need to start memorizing their names (a trick I mastered for my class). BTW, if anyone's talking to my Sibb this summer, make him e-mail me.\u000aEnjoy your summers,\u000aJeff Moore, Class of 2010 \u000a

aV\u000aSince both of the most recent blog posts have talked about Candidates' Weekend, I decided that I am going to only briefly touch on that topic, despite the fact that the first one is in only a few days and is pretty much anyone is talking about. I know, I know, this is a blog often read by Prospies, and that's probably what you care a lot about, but there's really no sense in beating a dead horse, other than to say that I wish the internal scheduling were a bit better. And to say this: Candidates' Weekend was what really sold Olin to me. It was so much fun, meeting all the Oliners, and, I have to say, the campus was exactly nothing like what I was expecting. Of course, this comes from someone who applied because of the scholarship, and only knew that Olin was "somewhere around Boston." In my humble opinion, Candidates' Weekend is pretty freakin' awesome, and really fun if you want it to be.\u000aBut enough about that. I'm sure you've heard more than you can stand about Candidates' Weekend. So now I'm going to give a little update on the State of the Students at Olin...or at least what I know about it. The Big Four project teams (Revo, Baja, Sailbot, HPV) are revving, up: almost all of them have an entire vehicle of some sort or another to finish this semester, and I can tell you from the Sailbot end that things are totally crazy. There are so many boats.\u000a\u000aI know from my friend in Revo that they are busily trying to build a tricycle, and I'm sure that the other two teams are working hard as well.\u000aIn other news, Olin's acapella group, PowerChords, went to ICCA (the big yearly competition) this weekend. They (and by that I mean we since I am a member of the group) performed three songs with choreography, and managed do improve upon our score from last year. Our music director, Kyle McConnaughay was awarded "Best Arrangement" for one of the songs. Overall, even though we did not advance to SemiFinals, we were very proud of how we did.\u000a\u000aLink to a proper gif: http://gifmaker.me/PlayFrameAnimation.php?folder=2014021014eD06nsXn7pyFb...\u000aThis wonderful gif is our final pose. Pretty fancy if I do say so myself.\u000aAnd finally, I feel that I must at least attempt to address Valentine's Day, since it is coming up remarkably fast. What I have to say is this: whether you are single or dating, whether you get a bouquet of roses from half a dozen people or the only flowers you get are the ones you doodle in your notebook, whether you have a roomful of chocolate or you just went out and bought it yourself, I hope your day is still wonderful!\u000a\u000aThis is currently on my door. Doctor Who humor. :D\u000aHappy Valentine's Day! And, if any of you out there are coming to Candidate's Weekend, good luck, and have fun!\u000a

aV\u000aThere's one lesson I will never forget from working on Carnegie Mellon's Formula SAE Team: "figure out how much time you think a job will take. Then plan for three times that amount". It's surprisingly accurate, actually. I bring it up because I will be flying home on July 30 (in 122.2 hours, according to WolframAlpha) and I had rather hoped to be more or less done with everything. True, there's still anabstractdue August 10 and a paper to write, but I could work on that anywhere. The plan was to take data today, do some analysis, get the abstract done, then fly home. I'd enjoy the last month of summer and work on the paper once school got started.\u000a\u000aHopefully that will remain largely true, but I certainly didn't get data collected today. Whilst I am a huge fan of learning by doing, it must be said that it usually results in designing one thing and building something completely different. Having finally got a new airfoil rapid-prototyped, I thought I would "only" have to force an aluminium tube through it and pin a steel rod into said tube. "Only". Ha.\u000a\u000aProblem 1: due to the RP machine's resolution, the tube is .05 inches wider than the hole in the wing. Which means hammering the tube all the way through is a) very hard because of friction and b) not a good idea because it'll start to crack the wing in a very important place. Happily, I got around this by using two shorter tubes, one on each end. It occurred to me that only half of the tube is actuallytransferringload from the steel to the wing, while the other half was just there to hold the thing up. So there, problem averted.\u000a\u000aProblem 2: I tried pinning the tube and the steel together over the weekend. They didn't want to play nicely, so I gave up and tried again this morning. There were playing slightly nicer and then the spring steel broke altogether. Oops. Now I could try making a new piece of spring steel, but Carnegie Mellon taught me another valuable lesson: when something breaks, it usually means that the design is no good, not that you were unlucky.

aV\u000a- By Maia Bittner '11\u000aOlin has gotten a fair amount of press recently related to the "new" tri-college partnership. I put new in quotes because many of the students here at Olin read the articles detailing our partnership and thought "Well, yeah, we've been doing all those things for years!".\u000aNone the less, I'm excited to see other people sharing my enthusiasm for cross-college collaboration. Like many schools, there's so much going on in terms of friends, activities, homework, and projects at Olin, it's easy for us to get stuck inside the "Olin bubble". To be frank though, larger neighboring colleges have a lot to offer us (both tangible and intagible benefits). \u000aI've sung the praises of cross-registering before (7 of my classes in the last 3 semesters have been at other schools), so I won't repeat myself. Instead, over the next couple blog posts, I'd like to detail some of the other cool, interesting, or useful resources available to Olin students from schools in the surrounding area. Many are old hat to Olin students; a couple I consider hidden or just overlooked gems. Keep an eye out for them!\u000aWellesley CollegePhoto by Rocio Garza\u000a

aV\u000aI first have to start this post by apologizing for how egregiously late it is. At first, I just postponed it by a day and suddenly, the next thing I knew, it was 2 and a half weeks later. I'm sure many of you know that feeling.\u000a\u000aBut on to the topic at hand. Around the time I was actually supposed to post this, I had to go drive into Needham in order to do some shopping. For those of you who don't know, Massachusetts drivers are completely insane. This particular quality is not helped much by the fact that most of the roads don't bother being straight and that there are 5 and 6 way non-right angle intersections everywhere. So in the approximately mile and half stretch of road that I drove between leaving Olin and returning, I managed to witness the following traffic shenanigans.\u000a\u000aSomeone parking in the middle of an intersection. They had a green light, they pulled out looking like they were going somewhere, and then they just stopped. And then, when my side had a green light and I drove across, they decided to honk at me, as if I was the one at fault.\u000a\u000a\u000aAn intersection that has a "right turn" light, but, in fact, has two "right turn" roads that lead away from it, and have lights at different times. It was quite fun to try and figure out when I got to go.\u000a\u000a\u000aA road entirely full of potholes from the ridiculous amount of snow that we've had here this winter.\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd, of course, the obligatory person trying to go 20 miles above the 30 mph speed limit right behind me.\u000a\u000a\u000aAll of this got me to thinking about how college is a bit like my driving experience. Sometimes (but not often) there's people who decided to park in your way, and all you can do is either find ways to help them, or just go around them. You also may not know the exact way you want to go when you start out--there may be two right turns which both look correct and you just have to guess which one is really the one you want. If it's not right, well, then you just come back and go at it again. And sometimes there will be people who are encouraging you to do things you may not want to do (tailgating you) and you just have to keep to your convictions and continue on.\u000aOverall, the road through college is a little bumpy and full of potholes at times, but at the end you'll be feeling pleased that you made it through, and you'll have some good stories to tell about it.\u000a

aVThis semester is turning out to be an excellent amalgamation of reflecting on my education. From the book Im reading for fun to think about information dissemination in high schools, to my research that lets me think about how Olin education continues into lifelong learning, to the education course Im taking at Wellesley that lets me think about my own education from K to Olin.
p716
aVA lot of upperclassmen talk about going through their mid-college crisis. They question whether engineering is really what they want to pursue in their life. Im thinking about the same thing sometimes, or at least trying to figure out how I can integrate my passions for coding and education into what I do later in life.
p717
aVBut the other thing about upperclassmen is they talk about being jaded. Theyre grumpy and anti-social and grumble about how hard it is to meet first-years when we live in separate buildings. They grumble about Olin.
p718
aVMy education class is giving me a new outlook. In some cases  it does make me more jaded. The first part of the course involved a lot of readings and discussions about inequalities in schools, and how some schools stifle their students opportunities. Its made me think about ways in which Olin can be improved.
p719
aVBut most importantly, its making me think about all the things Olin has gotten right. Our midterm project is to do observations in K-12 schools, and our professor reminds us how important it is to do what he calls appreciative inquiry  to look at schools through our newly focused critical lenses, but to remember to look for the good.
p720
aVLast week, I had the privilege of accompanying a group of Oliners to a film screening of "Most Likely to Succeed", a movie whose producer also filmed footage at Olin. It discussed elements of alternative schools and how they foster student growth and creativity. And I was able to see Olin within the elements of the high school shown in the documentary, just like Im able to see Olin in the discussions in my education class about progressive education.
p721
aVIt makes me really appreciative of what we do here. I think its important to be able to think critically about why we do what we do, because how else would we iterate and improve? But the balance, and looking for the good, is also important. And Olin is pretty cool.

aV\u000aIn high school I was tasked with writing a Philosophy paper about any subject I wanted.\u000aI had recently been reading Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, and stuck in my mind was the concept of happiness.\u000aAristotle defined happiness as eudaimonia, or living well and having sufficient resources to live.\u000aI disagree.\u000aBrave New World got me thinking about the difference between being content and being happy. Huxley's society members are perfectly made for the lives they leave. They are genetically predestined to be "happy." But when a "savage" enters their society from the wild, he begins to realize that being comfortable and being content are not enough.\u000aI think that you have to have experienced sadness and hardship to truly be happy.\u000aA grew up in a typical middle class home. My dad worked, my mom stayed at home. I went to private school, played 2.5 sports and ate dinner at the table every night. But just because it sounds stable does not mean there was not hardship. When I was a freshman in high school my dad was diagnosed with cancer. When I was a sophomore my first long-term relationship ended. When I was a senior, my favorite teacher passed away.\u000aBut overall in my life, I was comfortable. I didn't have to worry too much about money, my dad's cancer was caught early and treated, I got over my sophomore boyfriend, and my friendships were strengthened in the face of loss. That is the kind of give and take I am talking about. I do not believe that there is any ordinary act of sadness, loss, or pain that is not in turn counterbalanced by happiness, fulfillment, and relief.\u000aI don't think I truly understood happiness until I truly felt its absence.\u000aLast year at my previous college, I was deeply unhappy. I was uncomfortable with the social life and I was unchallenged academically, and I found myself in a situation where I could either change who I was as a person and compromise my moral values, or I could be alone. I ended up choosing to be alone, and by Christmas break I was diagnosed with depression. I learned to live with the situation I was in, and I lived out my year at WC.\u000aIn contrast, life at Olin has shown me what I was missing when I was comfortable in high school, and unhappy at Wofford. Happiness here looks like deep friendships, philosophical talks until the wee hours of the morning, the freedom to be whoever you want to be, teachers that care about you as a person, and a support system that extends into every area of life and comes from everyone here.\u000aI have never been happier than I am at Olin, and I needed to experience hardship and sadness to recognized and understand how happiness feels.\u000aI'll leave you all with a quote from Brave New World:\u000a"I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin."\u000a"In fact," said Mustapha Mond, "you're claiming the right to be unhappy."\u000a"All right then," said the Savage defiantly, "I'm claiming the right to be unhappy."\u000a"Not to mention the right to grow old and ugly and impotent; the right to have syphilis and cancer; the right to have too little to eat; the right to be lousy; the right to live in constant apprehension of what may happen tomorrow; the right to catch typhoid; the right to be tortured by unspeakable pains of every kind." There was a long silence.\u000a"I claim them all."\u000a

aV\u000aSummer is here, and the 9-5 work day has begun. This summer is a different experience from those in the past, primarily because I'm living on my own. I'm working for an email and web hosting company as a "Creative Consultant"- basically this means I make their sales and marketing stuff, then write HTML or do QA (ie. try to break the email and record the bugs) in between.\u000a        \u000aThis was essentially what I did last summer as well, so adjusting to the work atmosphere hasn't been too difficult. I now share an office with Steve ('06), which is pretty fun and very loud.\u000aWhat has been an adjustment has been the sort of dealing with landlords and older houses on my own. I'm living in Jamaica Plain, one of Boston's neighborhoods, this summer with two Simmons College students. When I moved in, I found out that we had only intermittent electricity- we eventually found out that a circuit breaker had  partially melted.\u000aAfter mice, no internet, a heat wave, and a lot of paint, the place is starting to be a lot more homey. My room is getting nicer even a bit less bare than this photo indicates:\u000a\u000aNow that the house is getting closer, I've been wandering around the neighborhood more. I've found festivals, parks, hippie stores, and ponds nearby, and I'm really enjoying the city. It's very different from Olin, but I still have Oliners- which are really the best part of the college- nearby.\u000a-Jessi\u000a

aV\u000a        "There's a balance--between overlooking important and preventable modes of failure, and taking so long to evaluate every possible chain of events leading to failure that technological progress is halted. But where do you draw the line, especially when people's lives are involved?"\u000a"How do you deal with people passing memos around, ignoring problems even when they are red-flagged, and pushing through to deadlines even when something is potentially unsafe?"\u000a"Do we strive for immortality? How will far will technology go to this end? How does that affect our idea of self? What does it mean to be human?"\u000aThese issues came up in my classes just today.\u000a        I love that Olin doesn't just claim to teach engineering in a broader\u000acontext, it actually does. We had a great discussion in Failure\u000aAnalysis and Prevention today, which was combined with the History of\u000aTechnology class for an hour so that we could share perspectives. In\u000aBiology, weekly 'media discussions' always spark interesting\u000aconversations centered around recent articles in the media. \u000aWhile\u000asometimes I simply enjoy the change of pace, I also appreciate the\u000aawareness I am developing of the 'big picture.' In Sustainable Design,\u000awe have a mantra: "There are no sustainable products, only sustainable\u000asystems." Even if you design something to use all-recycled materials,\u000aits impact will still be high unless you ensure that the product will\u000abe recycled at the end of its life. And that requires understanding the\u000asystem into which the product goes when it leaves the manufacturer.\u000aIt\u000asounds like common sense, doesn't it? But I'm constantly surprised at\u000ahow little consideration seems to have been given to some of the\u000asystems around me. I'm glad that Olin's curriculum is known as the\u000a"Olin Triangle," one side for science & engineering fundamentals,\u000aone side for liberal arts, and one side for entrepreneurship.We're\u000areminded often that engineering and design extend beyond the technical\u000asolution to a given problem. We need to ask if we're solving the right\u000aproblem. We need to anticipate the ways in which our designs might fail\u000aand prepare for those. We, above all, cannot make the mistaken\u000aassumption that we function within a vacuum, unaffected by and unaware\u000aof the context of our work.\u000a

aV\u000aHey all,\u000aFirst off I apologise for being a complete lazy bum about blogging for the past couple weeks. They've been pretty crazy for me with putting out the Annual Review, CORe elections, transition etc. Congratulations and good luck to Jeff, who is now our new VP, and the lucky one to deal with all this here on.\u000aI also attended the Society of Women Engineer's (SWE) Region F conference this past weekend. At this conference, Olin's SWE Chapter successfully put in a bid to host next year's regional conference AT OLIN!  I'm pretty psyched about this from both a personal perspective, as well as from an Olin student perspective.\u000aFrom my perspective because this means that we get some say in the sessions and activities that are offered as part of the conference. I've attended one national and one regional SWE conference thus far, and in my limited exposure, I've been pretty disappointed with the topics, impact and\u000a         attitude of some of the sessions. I feel like given the number of incredibly intelligent and talented men and women attending these conferences, we have the potential to host much more effective sessions. Sure this means that we might have to step on some toes to address the issues that are front-centre controversial today, sure this means that we might have to shelve tried-and-tested talks to design new sessions from scratch -- but, hey, what else would you expect from Olin students?\u000aI'm also excited from a little more selfish Olin perspective because of the number and caliber of individuals this event is going to bring on campus. This year, over 150 collegiate SWE members, 100 professional SWE members and over 20 companies were present at the conference. This is going to be a great chance for us to share the Olin story and show off our funky new school. Woo!\u000aTalking about people hearing of our school, a couple of us were socialising at MIT this past weekend, and almost everyone I talked to responded with an "oh, you must be smart," or "wow", or "yeah, I applied there too" when we mentioned that we're students at Olin. This is a HUGE change from two years ago, when we'd responses ranging from "what's that?" to "are you in Massachusetts on vacation?" to "uh-huh, sure." My all time favourite is definitely still the dude that tried to convince me that he knew someone that graduated from Olin "a couple years ago" back in Fall 2004. It's going to be a long long time before I stop being excited about running into people that either recognize or are interested in Olin. In fact, I wonder if it will ever get old.\u000aAlso, here's a picture of a crazy police station in Boston that we drove past on our way to the SWE conference:\u000aThat's all I've got for now, thanks for reading!\u000a- Meena\u000a

aV\u000aThis summer I am not staying at Olin, nor am I living on my own. Though some of my friends are staying in their first apartments in cities they had never seen before, I am one of the lucky rent-free stay-at-home students. Fortunately, my Olin-sickness is easily relieved by the fact that I live about 20 minutes away by car. Due to this, I've found it easy to stay in touch with my friends doing the NASA program or other research at Olin, in addition to all the people staying in Boston/Cambridge or even the Worcester area.\u000aWhat else does this mean? I get to go to awesome appropriate technology talks.\u000aAs you may have read, Amy Smith came to speak at Olin earlier this year. Right now at MIT is the International Development Design Summit led by Amy Smith. A recent graduate, Laura, sent out an email recently to tell us about some of the public talks. My roommate for next year sent me a message asking if I wanted to go, so pretty soon I found myself at MIT.\u000aThe talks were amazing; that night featured microbial fuel cells, turbineless wind power (by Humdinger Wind Energy LLC), and solar water disinfecting bags. Afterwards we went to a classroom to eat desserts and chat. At first I stuck to talking to Jef ('09) and Becky ('10), but Laura told us that we were forbidden from talking to each other when there were such amazing people in the room. As much as I enjoy talking to Oliners, I ended up being glad she intervened. Seeing the projects that some people had done, I was floored. It seemed almost magical how these people had seen a problem and then figured out elegant and appropriate solutions. It made me resolve to do more with OSA this year, and hopefully some of you '11ers will join in the fun as well.\u000a

aV\u000a        Over the last few weeks I've been observing an unusual meteorological phenomenon-not only is the sun visible, it's noticeably warm during the day! Add that to the fact that I can see all of the grass, walkways and other ground covering and frankly...I'm not sure what to make of it. Isn't is supposed to be winter in this hemisphere?\u000aComing from Oregon, I had a vague idea going to school in Massachusetts would mean "colder", but I figured it would be no big deal. After all, snow happens a couple times a year at home, is easily accessible in larger quantities on our nice big mountains and we certainly have our share of cloudy, rainy days. \u000aI'll admit there were some bumps along the way my first winter out east-the sad realization that a couple inches of snow doesn't actually always translate to a snow day, the glorious realization that boots are a much better response to "my sneakers get wet when I wear them in the snow" than "huh, I guess I'll wear sandals", and the general resetting of standards such that "it's really cold today" means a little more than "I might even have to wear a sweatshirt".\u000aSo after all that adapting, what do I find this year? Well, I substituted this "fall" for a "spring" and came back to a very mild winter-we haven't had any snow at all since we all returned in the ~3rd week of January! It feels like I'm cheating at Massachusetts! And to be honest, at the risk of ruining it for everyone who's seen enough snow to last a lifetime, I'll admit I've been secretly hoping for a nice, heavy snowfall (Note: Just checked the forecast; 50% chance of snow for Saturday!). How about it northeast?\u000a

aV\u000a        Last month was FULL of awesome community service projects! This post will be mostly photos, partially because I love pictures, and partially because I am pressed for time =].\u000aThe first thing that happened [of high importance] was Relay for Life, the American Cancer Society's number 1 fundraiser. The idea behind this amazing fundraiser is that cancer never sleeps, so neither do we. Members of teams take turns walking around the track overnight. We celebrate our survivors, remember those we've lost, and fight back against this disease, to try and make a world with less cancer and more birthdays. I'm a member of the Wellesley College committee [pictured here, at approximately 4 am]\u000a\u000a         About 50 Olin students came out to support the Wellesley-MIT Relay for Life. Olin's team raised over $5500 dollars, making us the 3rd highest fundraising team! Most of this was from penny wars, an awesome inter-class competition in which pennies count for +1 point, and everything else is negative.I wrote about our Relay experience in an article in the Frankly Speaking, Olin's student-run news source. One of the ceremonies at this event is a luminaria ceremony, which I described in the above article. To get a sense of what is described, take a look at this:\u000aIt was absolutely breathtaking. The following week was spring break, where a group of 21 Oliners headed to Concord, North Carolina for a Habitat for Humanity Build! Here's us at the house we worked on: \u000aOf course, it wouldn't be a break without a little exploration! There's a beautiful waterfall not toooo far from where we were staying, so off we went! We're kind of a crazy bunch...\u000aKeep in mind that North Carolina is really far from Boston [in the sense that it took around 14 hours each direction in the car]. Before we headed back to the North East, we ate at Waffle House! Here's Tim ['13], Maddie ['15] and me [from left to right], ready to hit the road...at 3 am!\u000aHopefully I don't get int too much trouble for posting this...Tim hasn't seen it himself! \u000aThe next [and final] major community service project in March involved REACH, a local organization that aids victims of domestic violence. They also have a large advocacy program, which includes life-size wooden cutouts that represent victims of homicides related to domestic violence. Facilities graciously allowed us to use a large space, and we helped paint 127 wooden figures over the last weekend in March!\u000aThanks to the rest of SERV for all of their help coordinating some of these projects, and Tim, who coordinated the Habitat build! Look out for a post from me about my classes and projects, which are coming to a [scarily quick] end!\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

This is the first of three weekends where ~65 prospective Oliners will flood our campus, meeting new friends, learning more about Olin, participating in the Design Challenge, wandering around the dorms meeting students, attending club fair, and just generally having a fantastic time. For those of you attending, here's a pro tip: Be yourself!! Have fun!! This weekend is about figuring out if you and Olin are a good fit, and that's a two way street. Find current students and ask them a bazillion questions, notice things, explore! I'm one of the student interviewers, so maybe I'll see you around. Stop me, ask me ANYTHING!\u000aIn honor of the crazy amounts of snow you see all over campus, please enjoy this snow related story.\u000aAt the end of last month, a group of 5 of my friends and I headed over to one of our professor's houses for a special adventure. We had won the SERV auction item* entitled "Sledding with Rebecca Christianson".We had waited patiently for our first blizzard, and now that we had enough snow for Rebecca's sledding hill of choice to be ready, we planned our weekend. We drove over to Rebecca's house to meet up, and then headed to the hill together. We had brought some sleds that assorted Oliners had loaned us. Rebecca also had a huge supply of different shapes and sizes of sleds. The hill was the biggest sledding hill I had ever seen!** We started climbing up, higher and higher and higher. I'm not going to lie, I was kind of scared. Especially when I saw how fast other people were flying down the hill. This was my first time sledding on something bigger than the slightly sloped lawn of my grandparents house in New York. We got to the top, and posedfor a quick picture. Then we began sledding!\u000a\u000aMeghan '17, David '18, me '17, Jacob '17, Gabrielle '17 (hidden somewhere), Rebecca (all the way down the hill), Photo cred to Emily '17 (behind the camera)\u000aWe spent about an hour or two testing out all the different sleds and picking our favorites. It became my goal to make it all the way down the hill each time. So even if I crashed into a snow bank or fell off, I would get back on and keep going. It was a lot of work to climb up that hill, and I wanted to get my money's worth.\u000aIt was sooo cold. I thought that I had dressed warmly enough with fleece lined leggings under jeans, a heat holding long sleeve shirt, another shirt, a fleece jacket, a winter jacket, gloves, and a hat. But when you flip off your sled and land face first into a snow bank, that's cold. When your eyelashes freeze, that's cold.\u000aAfter we had all gotten good and frozen, we headed back to Rebecca's house where we changed into warm, dry clothes. (Soooo glad we remembered to bring those!) Then we sat down around her kitchen table and warmed up with hot chocolate and cookies.\u000aIt was not only the best sledding adventure I had ever been on, but also a really great way to get to know Rebecca and meet her family. Next year, we are definitely planning on bidding on this item again!\u000aEnjoy Candidates' Weekend and the snow!!\u000a-Meg\u000a*SERV: Support, Encourage, and Recognize Volunteerism, our volunteer and service organization on campus. Check out their website here.(You can even see me bidding on this very auction item in the picture! I'm in the green plaid shirt.)Every year SERV has a charity auction where students, professors, faculty, and alumni submit items to the silent and live auctions. These items range from fun experiences like ours to homemade food to bringing back fun gifts from overseas. It's a great way for Oliners to give back, and this year we raised over $9,000 to donate to Doctors Without Borders.\u000a**I'm from Texas, so snow isn't really something I'm familiar with.

aV\u000a        It's the middle of April and the big question of "What happens after graduation?" looms large for any graduating senior. I'm happy to report that my fellow members of Olin's class of 2010 have done extraordinarily well in the intense job and graduate school market. \u000aHere's a brief run-down of where some of my class is headed after stepping off the commencement stage on May 16. Of course, several are still searching for that perfect position, but I'm really impressed with our success so far, so I had to share.Graduate Schools*MIT (4) Stanford (2)Carnegie Mellon (3)UC-Berkeley (1)UC-San Diego (1)UCLA (1)Northwestern (1)Brown (2)U. Illinois (1)U. Penn (1)U. Colorado (1)Fulbright (1 so far, 2 more waiting to hear back)\u000aIndustry*Google ( 2, project management and software development )Microsoft ( 7 , project management and software development )Rockwell (1)GE Health Care (1)Athena Health (1)Intuit (1)Lexmark (1)Optiver (1, financial trading)\u000aNot bad for the fifth graduating class of a brand-new institution, I'd say. Especially since when I arrived in August 2006 we weren't even accredited. \u000aProspectives take note. Just imagine how much more well-known the Olin brand will be by the time you complete four years here. Don't forget that the benefit of going to a small, tight-knit school like Olin is that alumni will be accessible and ready to help you out!\u000a\u000a        * As is always the case with these kinds of lists made by one\u000aperson, I'm sure I've made some mistakes or left many people's future\u000aplans out. All errors are my own. Oliners, please email me with\u000asuggested additions/corrections... or add a comment below.\u000a

aV\u000aHey everyone!\u000aIt's been almost two months since my last post and classes just end today! With finals next week, even though I'm a freshman with pass/ no-record, things are getting busy. What's different from other schools is that I choose to spend time on what I want to do, rather than being forced to study for exams.\u000aRight now I'm most excited about making a cube that will light up different colours depending on what colour I put it on. It's an extended version of my Isim project of building a colour sensor. My partner and I are doing more work than we have to, but it makes us so happy when we see our LED light up when we want them to!\u000aAfter I put everything onto proto boards I'll hopefully 3D print a cube container out of clear plastic. 3D printing is really fun and convenient (I've printed a DIY iphone case). It's a great resource that Olin has. You need to get trained and then you can print whatever you want.\u000aSo taking a break from final projects, I will share some fun things I did recently:\u000aSkating at Babson's indoor skating center is one of my favorite activities. This semester we had two nights (11pm-12pm) of Olin-only skating that's free for us all. Although not a pro yet, I feel much comfortable on the ice now.\u000a\u000aAbove: Babson's Skating Center\u000aLastly, remember the aerogami co-curricular I talked about in my last post? This week we had the last meeting and I was able to finish this very complex aviocar, in pink!\u000a\u000aToday I went to the discovery museum with eDisco (Engineering Discovery, an organization here at Olin that teaches engineering to primary school students). We had the entire museum to ourselves (Yes, college freshmen rather than primary school students) and each of us got a fascinating harmonograph picture. Each harmonograph drawing is unique, and all of them are really pretty!\u000a\u000aWith 9 days left at Olin before going home, I'll miss all the resources for the interesting things I'm doing here, the awesome student life and living with my classmates. But I look forward to having car rides every day, home-cooked food and to a certain extent, lots and lots of snow in Toronto.\u000aAgain to Prospies: Good luck on college applications! And don't worry if you don't have much engineering experience yet. Start now, and after a semester at Olin, you will know much more.\u000a* In case you are wondering about the title, you will find out when you come to Olin! Or ask me if you want (Xiaozheng.Xu@students.olin.edu) . (It's something really funny and random.)\u000aUntil next time. \u000a

aV\u000aNext Tuesday, October 20th, Olin will welcome William Kamkwamba to speak to the community in the auditorium at 5 pm.\u000aThree years ago, William had never been away from his\u000avillage in Malawi, had never used a computer, had never seen "an Internet."\u000aToday, the 22 year old has been featured on the cover of the Wall Street\u000aJournal, has spoken at TEDGlobal 2007 and 2009, has been a guest on the Daily\u000aShow, and has co-authored a book about the "simple machine that changed [his]\u000alife." This simple machine was a wind turbine he created out of scrap parts, a\u000apicture in a library book, and the determination to secure a brighter future\u000afor himself and his family. He built his first windmill at the age of 14, after\u000asuffering through a famine and dropping out of school because he was unable to\u000apay the $80 fee. Slowly, his story trickled into a Malawian newspaper, then\u000aonto African blogs, then onto the screen at the 2007 TEDGlobal Conference in\u000aTanzania... Since then, praise and support has steadily poured in from around the\u000aworld.\u000aBryan Mealer, a\u000awriter for Harper's and correspondent for the Associated Press who spent many\u000ayears covering "Africa's cycle of misery and horror", caught wind of William's\u000astory and ultimately ended up co-authoring a book with him. In a recent essay,\u000ahe comments:\u000a"Spending a year with William and writing this book helped remind me of why I fell in love with the continent in the first place. The Boy Who Harnessed the\u000aWind is the kind of against-all-odds tale that resonates with every\u000ahuman being, the kind of story that we all need to hear now and again to remind\u000aus of our own potential. We love these stories because within them, we look for\u000aourselves. I'm proud to have finally found that story in Africa."\u000aDespite his rapid\u000arise to world fame, William remains extremely humble and wants to return home\u000aafter his education to continue innovating for a better future. He is currently\u000aa senior at the African Leadership Academy in Johannesburg, South Africa, and\u000ahopes to attend college in the United States.\u000aOn a more\u000apersonal note, I met this remarkable young man this past summer at Maker Faire\u000aAfrica in Ghana, and like many others I was incredibly moved by\u000ahis story. It was wonderful to see the respect he garnered from his African and\u000ainternational peer innovators, tinkerers, and inventors.\u000aIf you are in the\u000aBoston area next Tuesday evening, I strongly encourage you to come meet William\u000aand hear his talk. In many ways William's story embodies Olin's approach to\u000aengineering as described by our mission statement:\u000a"Olin College prepares students to become exemplary engineering\u000ainnovators who recognize needs, design solutions, and engage in creative\u000aenterprises for the good of the world."\u000a

aV\u000aIt's been over two months and I can't believe it. It seems like orientation was simultaneously yesterday and a couple years ago. But it's the middle of November and Thanksgiving break is rolling around, and I'm excited to go back home to see family and friends.\u000aLife here doesn't ever stop; it's so exciting. I've joined so many clubs, tried so many new things, and am busy almost every second of the day. My brain has finally kicked back into action-and now it's time for my first break. I wonder what the world will be like from my changed perspective.\u000aI have learned a vast amount in such a short period of time. I can CAD quite a bit on Solidworks, and have started to understand MATLAB. Photography is awesome, and I can finally operate my Canon 50 D camera easily and use Adobe Lightroom to edit. I'm still having a bit of trouble with Mod Con(Modeling and Controls-- lots of acronyms here), but I'm slowly getting to a point I'm comfortable with.\u000aThe stress of course registration has passed, and this week is crunch time, so that I can relax during Thanksgiving Break. That doesn't mean I will stop working, though.During break Iwill be CAD-ing for Transporters(our Design Nature project), talking to my partner for my Mod Sim project (railgun and perhaps magnus forces?), and probably Latex-ing another lab(Mod-Con). But it's not just work anymore; it's more like something I am passionate about and am happy to do.\u000aI feel like I am finally able to balance my life with my work with my sleep to have a happy medium (closer to meanactually) and enjoy what I am doing. I have learned a lot after these months like being behind on work is a pain, bribing yourself with sleep is effective, and friends are the people who you hang out with even when speaking English becomes difficult.\u000aBut most of all I have realized that even though life here hurtles forward at a breakneck place, I'm satisfied here. I continue to look forward to the rest of my 4 years at Olin.\u000a\u000aHere is a picture of my ballet slippers. Ballet is my Passionate Pursuit which I get funding for. I took this picture with my 50D and purposefully captured all the shadows. In addition to ballet, I have joined two project teams(Mini-Baja/AERO), OFAC(fire arts club where I am learning fire-hoops), Blues, Frankly Speaking(editor for this school newspaper), and started my own club. No wonder I'm sleep deprived, right?\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWow, it's the first day of spring, and I can't believe it's almost April! The beginning of April at Olin means it's time for Big Conversations the Engineer of the Future 2.0 conference!\u000a        \u000aUsually (well, as usual as anything at Olin), we have Big Conversations on one of the first Wednesdays in April. Everyone likes Big Conversations - some,  because Olin brings in a cool speaker and the whole Olin community comes together to talk about big ideas concerning technology, society, and education, while some just like it because classes are canceled :)\u000aThis year, we're kicking it up a notch and hosting a grassroots summit in conjunction with the University of Illinois to talk about how to improve undergraduate engineering education outside of Olin. Everyone's invited - industry professionals, professors from universities around the country and local college students are already registered to come. It's happening on April 1, 2009, and you should come check it out if you're around!\u000aI've been working with the other UIUC ambassadors: Bryce ('10), Eddie ('11), James ('12), and Garrett ('10) to collaborate with the 13 Illinois students who will be flying out here and staying in Olin's residence halls for the event. We're also planning student breakout sessions for the summit which I'm really excited about. Yes, engineering students care about the state of engineering education and are willing to take a proactive stance and work to improve it! \u000aI'm impressed by the Illinois students - they're currently working on creating iFoundry, an innovative curriculum program that will incorporate some Olinesque ideals. It's starting next fall for incoming freshman - the students working to create it won't be participating in it. The work I do is usually more selfish - I'm looking to improve my education and experience!\u000aHope to see you April 1st! \u000aMaia\u000a

aV\u000a        Dear Prospective 2014er,\u000aWhile sitting in my room, staring down this week's vector calculus homework, my mind wandered to approximately one year ago, when I was [all too frequently] roused from slumber by dreams of swirling envelopes. Some large, some frighteningly thin, but all seemed to deliver the same thing -- my academic fate. Back in the present, I glanced at one of five calendars in the room and was startled by the date. Candidates' Weekends approach. Not so long ago, dear Prospie, I stood in your shoes. We all get it. Waiting is difficult, even agonizing, excruciating, vexatious, dreadful, caustic, and downright unpleasant.\u000a"Those Who Know" seem to simply overflow with wisdom at such times and are eager to share any and every thought they may have on the subject, and I do think I heard them all. But the most beneficial piece of advice I received during the waiting process was to, "Forget about Olin and all those other schools. You're [hopefully] only a high school senior once." I forced myself to focus on the here, the now, and with a bit of helpful distraction, managed to make it through the process alive. This vector calc business may nullify such an accomplishment, but that's a story for another day.\u000aFor now, I offer you some things to ponder as you wait to plan for the fall. Thanks to a lively group of fellow classmates, I am never at a loss for *ahem* stimulating ideas.\u000a        Consider, if you will:\u000athe life cycle of an Internet meme -- Talk to Eric '13 and Noah '13.\u000athe impending zombie revolution -- Stay away from room 406.\u000ahalf of a dorm floor covered with water-filled paper cups -- They are all stapled and/or taped together.\u000aextreme ironing -- Seriously. It's a real thing.\u000aJohn Philip Sousa -- Coolest guy ever?\u000a\u000aitems that declare the "World's Best [Noun]" -- Shouldn't stores stock only one of each?\u000a\u000a\u000aa hard copy of Facebook -- "Wall Posts: Chapter Eight"\u000athe consequences of converting to the metric system -- I'm fairly certain I would melt.\u000afacial hair -- Does its presence indicate an increased rate of villainy? (Many thanks to Matt for allowing me to use these photos...)\u000a\u000a90s pop music -- Should we be proud or hide in shame?\u000aa mechanical starfish -- How does one make this appealing to fourth graders? Is it possible for something to be so ugly that it becomes mildly adorable?\u000a\u000aradically rearranging furniture in a dorm -- It is far more difficult to shift two beds, two desks, two wardrobes, a fridge/freezer/microwave unit, and six shelving units around the room than one might imagine.\u000amarsupials -- Need I say more?\u000abananas -- How much mold can they produce in one month? (Answer: a fair amount)\u000a\u000aTake these thoughts for what you will. I know they've distracted me for countless hours already. As for the application nightmare, trust in the process; you will end up where you are supposed to be. Take a deep breath (or four), stop checking the mailbox (They only deliver once each day. Tragic, I know.), and have some fun. And remember that there's nothing wrong with a little nervous anticipation.\u000aFondly,\u000aYour Friendly Neighborhood Oliner\u000a\u000a\u000aPS: Others, please feel free to chime in!PPS: I have just been notified that some letters have been received!\u000a

aV\u000aNow that decisions are coming out (congrats to the future class of 2012!), I thought I'd take the chance to blog about how Candidates' Weekend appeared to me, an old sophomore. While last year I worked Design Build, the unevaluated team activity that candidates start out their Saturday with, this year I was a student interviewer.\u000aAt Olin, Candidates' Weekend is primarily a chance to get to know students on a deeper level than a paper application alone would allow. It's also a chance for the students to get to know the school. The only evaluative part here is an interview and a group discussion, judged by a team of three. I was placed on a team with Joe Hunter, the Director of Communications, and Will Clayton ('06). Some teams have faculty members instead of staff or alumni, but all have a current student.\u000aWhy is this? Olin is incredibly small, and it all comes down to fit. The hope is that students will know best who would fit in with other students. Sitting down with my interviewees, I could easily see bits  and pieces of other people that went to Olin. As we discussed the candidates, it was exciting to hear my opinion being weighed as just as important as the two who had interviewed close to 20 times between them.\u000aIn the end, we came to consensus and wrote up our comments for the admissions committee. It took us more than two hours, and I ended up having to grab dinner from the carts they had already loaded up to begin cleaning up.\u000aCandidates' Weekend can sometimes feel like a bit of a harsh process for a student who falls in love with Olin and then doesn't make it, but it is a necessary evil. In becoming an interviewer, I really learned how much effort goes into making every deliberation about every student. The amount of student involvement in the process is pretty much unheard of. I don't think that Olin could build its community in any other way.\u000a-Jessi\u000a

aV\u000aThe following post has been transmitted across the oceans by Mitch ('16.5) to me from his highly irregular LOA in Brazil.\u000aOlin is great and all, but one of my best experiences at Olin so far has been in this semester, the first time I've been away from Olin in two years. That's right folks, I've taken the fabled and legendary LEAVE OF ABSENCE.\u000aWhat is a Leave of Absence, you may ask? At Olin, an LOA is when you leave the school for a semester, usually to do something cool. They're nice in that a) there's no restrictions in what you can do, because you've left the school, b) you do not pay money to Olin, because you've left the school, and c) you get an 'extra' semester at Olin with a scholarship at the end, because you have 8 total semesters of scholarship, because you've left the school. It may seem counter-intuitive that one of the best experiences AT Olin is when you LEAVE it, but really, I'm so glad that Olin cares about its students enough to allow the flexibility to let students leave and do cool things with their lives.\u000aAditi, Cecelia (rising sophomores),Doyung and Mitch (rising juniors) at Insper\u000aSo what is this cool thing I'm doing, you may ask? Well, three otherOlin students and I have gone to So Paulo, Brazil, to help start a new engineering college at Insper business school. And if that doesn't sound like THE COOLEST THING EVER, allow me to explain. Every day, I work with Insper Engineering faculty members to design a curriculum that is innovative, hands-on, and entrepreneurial. I'm a consultant/collaborator on a huge project, and we're trying to make Insper a leader in Engineering Education in Brazil. And the school doesn't even exist yet! Sound familiar?\u000aIt's especially interesting, at least for me, because the semester I spend away from Olin is the one in which it's basically my job to think about Olin all the time. I've had a few insights about Olin, about Brazil and about myself, and I think now's as good a time as any to share them with you.\u000a1. Life is FANTASTIC, and people are great.\u000aReally, anywhere you go, from Needham to Vila Olmpia, there's always something to be happy about, and people to be happy with. When anybody used to ask me what my favorite thing about Olin was, I would always say something like "The people. Oliners are excited about engineering, passionate about doing something meaningful, and are generally just good people to be around. And that's pretty true of everybody, the students, the faculty, and the staff." The funny thing is this: I'm now convinced that people are my favorite thing about life! The people at Insper have similar passions, and are similarly kind and interesting. Almost every person I've met in Brazil is friendly, helpful, and fun. Really, anywhere you go, your experiences are not so much determined by what you do or how you do them, but the people you do them with. And in my opinion, there's always 'gente boa' to be with.\u000a2. Olin is really, really weird.\u000aThe student life at Olin is totally unique. Students at Olin spend a lot of their time with each other, and a lot of time working on their classes. That's probably somewhat true of any college, but at Olin, it's taken to an entirely new level. Something about spending all of your time with the same 350 people does something to you, where spending more time with those 350 people is all you want to do 90% of your waking moments. This goes back to my first insight, that people are great. But students at Olin have a zeal for life like you wouldn't believe, and they LOVE to learn, to the point where studying is a major 'fun' activity to do with friends. It helps that courses at Olin are interesting, and work feels more like play than actual work, but it really is STRANGE how close Oliners are to each other, and how much they love what they do. Add to that a student-faculty relationship that is so close it's staggering, compared to basically anywhere else, and Olin sounds more and more like an imaginary place than a real institution of learning. And that simple fact is very easy to forget while you're AT Olin.\u000a3. Everyone should take a break from what they're doing.\u000aAnd I'm not just talking about taking a coffee break, or going on vacation, but taking a full-blown month AT LEAST to step away from your life and do something else. Whether you're at Olin or at work or going to high school, this is a good idea. I love engineering, and although I talk about it all the time, I'm not 'doing engineering' like I do at Olin. And that's great! The work I do here is refreshing, interesting, and helps me be more reflective about my 'normal' life. I know that I will return to Olin more excited about my courses, and more excited to live a good life. My LOA opens my mind to new ways to think about the world, and that's gotta be good for just about everybody. So go press the pause button on your regularly scheduled life and do something exciting - you'll be glad you did.\u000aUm abrao,\u000aMitch\u000a

aV\u000a        The fickle fates of New England spring sent us an absolutely gorgeous day (sunny and seventy, for those of you who aren't in the area), and even after a mild winter like we've had this was cause for celebration. All day long, people congregated on the lawns by the dorms and in the Oval in the center of campus, dragging with them laptops, frisbees, picnic meals and the couches from the dorms. The rule of thumb was, if you can do it outside, you probably should.\u000a\u000a\u000a        As for me, I called an exception to a 2-week time management experiment about treating school like a 9-5 job* and shifted a bike ride into Needham to return a library book to the sunny afternoon. \u000aIn the evening, I joined some other Oliners in an impromptu music session. It was still warm outside! We had to use it somehow!Slight problem: I can't play any of these instruments. Problem solved: hand drums! Which I still have no skill at, but have a very, very, very low "hey-look-I-can-make-sound-happen" barrier, which was really all we were going for, and were lots of fun to play with.\u000aSpring break is next week-which means it's getting to be crunch time and I am feeling fairly ready for a break-but today was an excellent mini-break...a sun-day to make up for our lack of snow-days? A very good way to start the week.\u000a*I'll have some reflections about this next week. In the meantime, if anyone else has tried it I'd love to hear about it!\u000a

aV\u000aOn Saturday morning, I went out to the Olin soccer fields to support my boyfriend Jacob and the boys' team in their lastregular season game of the year. I met more Oliners on the sidelines and we started chatting before the game started up. Somehow it came up that I couldn't make Ultimate Frisbee practices anymore (the schedule changed when it started to get dark earlier). Someone suggested, "You should join the girls' soccer team! We have a game tomorrow!"\u000aI stopped to think about it. I wasn't doing anything tomorrow. Hey, why not? I warned them that I hadn't played since middle school but they said there were plenty of girls on the team who had never had any soccer experience before. Okay sure, I'm in.\u000aI borrowed shin guards, soccer socks, and a jersey from a fellow Oliner. The morning of the game, it was raining. Then, it started snowing. The first snow of the year came early! But the game was still on. As a Texas girl, snow still fascinates me and I was really excited to be able to have an excuse to run around in it. We only had one extra player as a sub so we were all on the field almost all the time. Which was actually good because: IT. WAS. FREEZING. We put our big sweatshirts and raincoats under our jerseys to try and stay warm. We looked like a team of marshmallows and hunchbacks, but hey, at least we were warm.\u000a\u000a(Look, you can even see the snow flurries!)\u000aThe game was a blast! I played defense, which was basically me just trying to stay between the other team and the goal. The other girls on my team were really considerate of my lack of soccer understanding. (I was one of three new recruits that week.) They answered all of my questions about game play and where I should stand and who I should be covering and on and on. (I ask a lot of questions!) We scored one goal in the first half and another in the beginning of the second half. By this point, the snow had really picked up and both teams agreed to call the game. So... we won!!\u000aThen to celebrate, Jacob took me to Starbucks to warm up with Peppermint Mochas!\u000a

aV\u000aHello again! As crazy as it seems, another semester here at Olin has nearly gone by, with only a few papers and presentations standing between us and winter break. This semesters end also marks the slightly-more-than-halfway point of my time here at Olin, and what a ride it has been so far. I wrote previously on the changes between first and sophomore year, and although the changes between sophomore and junior year have been somewhat less pronounced, theyve been just as exciting.\u000aJunior year crises! (Not quite what I planned on starting with, but parallels my last article the best ;) ). As were more and more often asking Whats next?, many juniors are really starting to think about what we want to do with our lives. Jobs? Grad school? What field? Ive always known I wanted to improve the world through health (hence the focus in bio), but now Im getting to the point where I need to start thinking more about the nitty-gritty of that. Its kind of scary, but also really exciting to start thinking about where all this is going!\u000aApplications! The more we learn, the more we build on what weve learned before. Im using lessons from User Oriented Collaborative Design not only in my current design class, Investigating Normal (Adaptive & Assistive Tech), but in my Feminist Bioethics class at Wellesley. Stock-and-flow framings from ModSim my first semester are coming back as I model the movement of cancer in BioTransport. As more and more lines connect different aspects of my education, Im also seeing how much Im using everything else Ive learned at Olin so far, and how I can bring this with me into the real world.\u000aNew dorms! Living in a suite this year means I have a whole ~12.5x9.5 space to myself that I can arrange and decorate however I like. My past roommate and I always did our best to have a homey feel to our space, and thats definitely carried over to my new living quarters. (Hint: curtains are what really does it.) From the mini-kitchen setup to the lamps I brought in, my room really does feel like my home. As were getting closer to Christmastime, I even brought some decorations from my more permanent home, tying ribbons around bedposts and lamps, hanging icicle ornaments from most surfaces, and, my personal favorite, striking up the Mickey Band on my windowsill. I even was able to bring some of the same fir-tree scent sticks from home to really make it cozy!\u000a\u000aMickeys Brass Band, playing all of your favorite Christmas classics.\u000aGetting the hang of things? Some things stay the same, as Im still Co-President of the Christian Fellowship and Glass Club, and again a NINJA (course assistant) for Six Microbes That Changed the World, however, Ive seen changes in each in our last loop around the sun! For instance, the Christian Fellowship had a retreat this year, for which my Co-President Sophie and I booked a cabin, planned meals, bought food, and organized transportation! It was a blast, and everyone seemed to have a great time and get a lot out of it.\u000a\u000aWe even fire-grilled our own dinner!\u000aAfter NINJAing Six Microbes last fall and two other courses in the spring, it was great being back in the lab and teaching again, especially when so many of the students are really excited about what theyre learning. (Final presentations just passed on Wednesday the 9th!)\u000aIn closing, its been another amazing whirlwind of a year. I still completely stand by the more you learn, the more you realize you don't know, and am excited to find out all the new things Ill realize I dont know over my next three semesters here.\u000aSee ya real soon!\u000aP.S. Prospies! Good luck with applications and essays! I remember how tough they were (and Im thinking about them even more as I draw closer to grad school applications). You can do it, and Im excited to meet some of you this spring at Candidates Weekend!\u000a

aV\u000a        I had lots of fun this candidate's weekend! Running the design build was nerve-wracking (I was as nervous as you! but overall rewarding, exhilarating, and spectacular! On Saturday night, west hallers really pulled all the stops. I wish I had been able to meet more candidates, but I was called away to play rehearsal. As predicted, I did no work this weekend, but our professors have been more than lenient this week with extensions. Anyways, I saw my classmates pick up my slack - and then some! Actually, if I've noticed a theme in the conversations I've had with regards to candidate's weekends, it's been "too much" and "too strong!"\u000a        It's true; we did a lot. I found the sheer energy captivating! Then again, I'm a freshmen, with no standard against which\u000ato hold my experience. Conversely, some\u000aof the more centered students thought that our lounge-wide nerf gun\u000abattle, the Mardi Gras hallway, antilounge dance party, and the _____\u000ashow in the _____ (sorry folks, it's a secret) were overwhelming and\u000afelt artificial. \u000aTo be honest, this surprised me. These are things we do at Olin. We really do\u000athem, and we love them! They are mostly new to the school as of this\u000ayear, reflections of the Class of 2013's ebullience, but still, they\u000aare accurate depictions of life here at Olin. Certainly, the events of a month had to be compressed into a weekend, but our enthusiasm\u000awith each event was genuine. This being said, I can see how from a\u000anewcomer's perspective, this approach might have seemed overeager or\u000afake. \u000aThere's also the problem that our vim and vigour crowded out the\u000alow-key conversations - heart to hearts that I enjoyed in my candidate's weekend. This was, I understand, the purpose of the visit to the dorms. Oops! The thing is, we wanted to entertain you, but this was also our opportunity to\u000abe real with you. We were to answer your questions person to person,\u000awhether the response was good or bad. \u000aWe want you to know all about\u000awhat life is like here, and still want to come!\u000aWith this in mind, I vow that we will reshape the weekends to come. Thank you to our\u000aguinea pigs, with whom we are enamoured. If you would now like to sit\u000adown and have an open talk with a current student, please contact me\u000aany time and I'll a) be your guy or b) connect you with someone. I'll\u000ado my best to get you the full CW experience! \u000aIt wasn't all negative! We set the bar high, but I know that it is very much within our reach to raise it much higher. We're looking forward to next week. I hope you're ready for us, candidates to come!\u000a

aV\u000a        The last two and a half weeks (I had to count it twice before I believed it hadn't been longer) have been a blur of hiking, long bus rides and rapidly changing weather, scenery and plans. Since the Navimag ferry dropped me off at 3am in remote Central Chilean Patagonia-the kind of place where even the main highway is unpaved and despite being in the southern hemisphere I still got a bit of pre-Christmas snow, I`ve been working my way south, bouncing in and out of Argentina (where the highway is still unpaved, but at least not mountainous). \u000aIt`s not always easy going-I`ve been snowed on, marooned in dead-end truck stop backwaters and just found out Torres del Paine--the world-famous national park that planted the idea of travelling in Chile in my heart over 10 years ago--is closed for the rest of January due to wildfire. And to be honest, that`s half the fun-although sometimes it takes a couple hours worth of perspective to remember that.\u000a        But even before those few hours of perspective kick in, the beauty of the landscape usually takes care of it. Everywhere I`ve been I could happily have spent longer in (LOA?). \u000a(Glaciar Perito Moreno near El Calafate-huge tourist trap, but you can see why)\u000aOver the last few weeks I`ve started planning less and less with results and more with processes-as in, I started this trip with a careful list of where I would be nearly every night (which I had to abandon less than 48 hours in), and now I have more of a mental flow chart of possible next moves from the possible locations I could end up in. For example, my current plan (hastily compiled this morning in light of the Torres del Paine news) is something of the following.\u000aTomorrow-bus to Punta Arenas (I actually have a bus ticket in advance! weird!)If <bus to Ushuaia monday> go to Ushuaia on monday -->hiking on Tierra del FuegoIf <bus to Ushuaia available but not until tuesday/wednesday>  If ferry running, visit penguins in Punta Arenas If bus running, visit Natl. Park near Punta ArenasElse If possible to go to Isla Navarino before Tuesday and return before Sunday If weather on Isla Navarino is good -->Lago Windhond hiking (several days trip) Else day hiking Else return to puerto montt or bariloche \u000aThe best part is, none of those are bad options :). Have another picture.(Sunrise at the foot of Mt. Fitz Roy)\u000a----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Technical note: this blog attracts a vast amount of junk comments-I do read through them all looking for real ones, but it's always possible I miss one-and occasionally there are some I`m not sure about.

aV\u000a        And that means a couple exciting things.\u000aCandidates will come to our campus over three weekends, and some short time after that, the Class of 2017 will be admitted to Olin College.\u000aTo make room for the Class of 2017, the 2013ers will be kicked out.\u000a\u000aWhile the first item is exciting, the second is certainly the heaviest on my mind at the moment.\u000a        There was certainly discussion among the class about how "strange" it was to begin our senior year, looking for jobs, grad schools, and other adventures. We began the long process of reflection on our progress as individuals and as a class. We joked about our aging bodies and warned the first-years just how quickly the time will go.\u000aYet, that was 2012. When the calendar flipped to 2013, the mental association with the year of my graduation from college sent warning signals to just about all of my sweat glands. This is the actual year!\u000aSure, many of my classmates accepted full-time job offers months ago and solidified post-graduation plans, but I heard from several of them just how real it all felt come January. Perhaps this seems a bit dramatic. The thing is, there are some relatively dramatic happenings for all of us this year.\u000aThere are plenty of exciting things to come in the next four months [and beyond], and I wish the best for all of my classmates and those progressing along the Olin journey right behind us.\u000aSpeaking of senior-year events, I am fortunate enough to be sitting in Chris and Scott's ('12) apartment in San Francisco, waiting for my SCOPE team to assemble for our mid-year presentation to Autodesk. We're missing our last first day of classes to do so, but I'm finding it worthwhile so far. Here's a view of the city from Alamo Park, where Chris took me today.\u000aI also touched the Pacific Ocean for the first time and have seen nine [former] Oliners. Not too shabby for a school trip.\u000aPS: To those Olin hopefuls waiting to hear about Candidates' Weekends, relax. There is nothing to do but wait and enjoy your final few months of high school. As we've learned today, the time goes quickly!\u000a\u000a

aV\u000a        It may have been an Olin Monday today (ugh), but Fat Tuesday was in full swing.\u000aThose of Polish descent may be familiar with pczki, extra rich filled doughnuts. Traditionally, they are eaten on either Fat Thursday or Fat Tuesday (more common in the US) to use up all the eggs, lard, sugar, and fruit before fasting during Lent. Basically, today was a fantastic excuse to pack on an extra handful of pounds.\u000aA few fellow Polish food enthusiasts and I planned an excursion to the Baltic Deli in Dorchester, a rather Polish part of Boston, to get our pczki and pierogi. But just before we headed out, our dining hall staff unveiled a surprise.\u000a        A few days ago, Stefania, our favorite Polish dining hall cashier (really my Olin mother), suggested to Meghan ('12) that she fill out a dining hall comment card requesting pczki. Word then spread to me, so I joined in the mini-campaign, expecting nothing but a few laughs (and the early pczek that Stefania gave us on Monday).\u000aWell, Dave, our dining services manager, decided the comments were worth something. This morning, sitting on the salad bar counter was a tray of homemade (still slightly warm) pczki, including plum, raspberry, and plain. The outer edges of the pastry were saturated with some form of grease; some had powdered sugar distributed over the top, others icing -- perfection.\u000aDave apparently started making the dough at 5:30am, and completed the rest of the tedious process in the Olin kitchen. Those familiar with the delight swarmed the counter, not bothering to leave the service area to stuff our faces. All were devoured before anyone could grab a photo, but here's some of my booty from the deli:\u000aFor the record, Dave's were better. Just one more reason to love our dining hall staff. Thanks for going the extra mile, guys!\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aIt is difficult to graduate. Maybe the work is challenging, but getting it done is the most difficult when you're trying to answer questions about the "rest of your life." It doesn't help that this is all anyone can think of to ask a second semester senior: What's Next?\u000aI'm siding with a few like-minded friends in saying "First things first." I've got business to attend to here at Olin. Maybe just 3 days of class and 2 weeks of work, but they're going to be full ones. That isn't to say I'm not keeping conversations with employers going, but I sure don't have many cycles to spare pondering which ones would provide personal satisfaction, professional development, security, inspiration, etc. Those very important issues will have to be addressed sometime after May 17th, Olin's fourth commencement.\u000aBesides, my SCOPE project just crystallized into a startlingly compelling story! By this I mean that 2.5 late night hours getting feedback on a final report draft from our faculty adviser Ben Linder brought the picture of what we've created for our sponsor into focus.  Our team's long trail of ambiguous-feeling product design exploration has crested onto a glistening mountaintop of clear problems with tractable solutions. I find myself all-but-psyched to hammer the year's results into a dazzling steely report that makes the sponsor think hard about the potential of executing the product we're proposing they manufacture. Let's hope this feeling get's me through Friday, when the report is actually due.\u000aIn 4 years, it has never been about doing more reasonable amounts of things. The key is to keep the fire burning that spurs you on; then the quantity of work pales in comparison to your desire to finish it.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe sudden burst of warmth has triggered flowery pyrotechnics all over campus.\u000a\u000aGood luck with your finishings,\u000a\u000aBennett\u000a

aV\u000aEvery Wednesday morning my routine is the same. Every Wednesday morning, I set an alarm for 9am, hit the snooze button three times, and roll out of bed by 9:15. Then I throw on clothes, make breakfast, and walk to my 10am class. I take off my jacket and shoes and sit on the studio floor. When we hear the music over the speakers, we know class has begun. We warm up for the first 5-10 minutes of class by stretching in our spaces, equidistant from each other, while music is playing in the background. Usually the first song is something calm, flowy, but still with climax. Think Adeles song for the old James Bond movie.\u000aThen after a few minutes, we hear the song change, accompanied with the words "partner up, stand equidistant from the other partners" from our loud, outspoken, blunt Britishprofessor. We know what to do by now. We partner up with another actor, facing our partners. One partner leads and the other partner follows. The "leading" partner does a series of exercises to stretch and warm up and use their body and the "following" partner mimics the "leading" partner. We hold eye contact the entire time. We never talk. Talking is not allowed during the entire morning. The only noise in the room is from the speakers. He yells at us again and the song changes to a cheesy, American song! Songs like Dancing Queen by ABBA, Tainted Love, Run the World by Beyonc, I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor, and so many more crazy songs. There's something about the volume and the complete and utter cheesiness of the songs that makes everyone want to DANCE. Then after some time, he yells at us to switch partners again. It's a whole new playlist every class period and I swear each song builds on the energy and cheesiness of the previous one, making us want to build on the energy and cheesiness. I have never shaken my behind more times than in that studio, every Wednesday morning.\u000aAfter a few rounds of partners, he will yell "two groups of five". There are ten people in my acting intensive, so this means make two groups of five people. We get in two large groups, equidistant from each other. Next one person becomes the leader for the entire group and the rest of the group mimics the leaders dance moves. Then gradually, somehow, without talking, the leadership role shifts to someone else. Any person from the group, whenever they feel like it, can start doing completely new dance moves and the rest of us eventually start following that person. Sometimes you can see a lag in snatching the leadership position and its really difficult to lead. Its a vicious cycle because usually the current person leading leads for a very long time, making the rest of us not want to lead. My best guess is that we are all afraid to take that leadership position because we are afraid to be the leader too long, we are afraid that we will run out of dance moves (you can only boogie and do the shopping cart move so many times, right?), and we think we will embarrass ourselves or seem uncreative. \u000aThe goal is to redirect the energy acquired during warmups to scene work later, become relaxed and comfortable in the space with all of the people dancing like clowns and dancing queens. This group dance exercise with a leadership position that flows from person to person is really interesting for me to analyze, especially because at Olin, we work in groups the majority of the time. \u000aThere is one group during my time at Olin that has seemed to function without a leader, my User Oriented Collaborative Design UOCD group of five. We were friendly with each other and knew each others names, but somehow at this small school, I had not interacted with them much before the group formation. UOCD is a class that incorporates people of all majors to design products for a user group. For the first few weeks, I would describe us as meek to make decisions. I think we were hesitant to be bold because we were not familiar with each other yet. Right before the end of our first sprint, we began taking leadership on different things. There was not a single person that consistently led. Similar to the dance boogie warmup in my theatre class, the leadership shifted positions. If two or three of my team mates went on a user visit, then they took leadership on making the persona board for that person. Mainly we were good at dividing tasks and group discussion. Sometimes we were assigned many long papers, several on each topic, on topics such as framing, personas, scenarios, and user visits. We used a suggested style of homework for the class where each one of us reads all of the papers for one topic and then delivers a breakdown of the content to the rest of the members. It felt like all of us were talented designers and when there were decisions that needed to be made, we would discuss. Leadership would flow between us and usually the person who did the reading on the topic would refer to the reading as supporting evidence. We were really good about blending all of our ideas into a product. I felt because the leadership position shifted from person to person, depending on the subject and the day, we were all leaders.\u000aShaking my tail feather to Dancing Queen in this group circle every morning reminded me so much of this group. In my dance circle on Wednesday mornings, I was forced to pay attention to all of my peers in my circle. I noticed their looks and their body language. If one seemed confident and eager, then they were about to lead and I should wait for their instruction. If one looked scared, then I knew that they were thinking about going next. If someone else was doing other dance moves, then I should follow them because they wanted to lead. If the current leader seemed wide eyed and scared, then they needed help and I would try to pull the leadership. If I was the leader, well then it was continuous crazy dancing. I think my favorite dance moves to whip out are: the shopping cart, the jive, the move your head to the right and move your head to the left, the sprinkler, and the hip clock pop, in order of favoritism.\u000aIt would be really interesting to have some groups at Olin perform this exercise. I wonder how, if, and why leadership dynamics would shift. This exercise has enhanced my body language expression skills, my observation skills, made me more confident in my ability to hold leadership, and literally think of new dance moves on the spot. It also makes you more energized and comfortable with your group because, well, you all just saw each other dancing like maniacs to old pop songs.\u000a

aV\u000aSome lucky people know what they would like to major in when they first enter college. Many people will have it figured it out after a year or so. Almost everyone is able to answer by the time they've declared in sophomore year. Then there are people like me.\u000aI'm in my third year of college. I submitted my paperwork declaring myself to be E:Robotics a full year ago -- or, as it appeared on my resum, I was a "Candidate for a Bachelor of Engineering with a Concentration in Robotics." I had a rigorous plan of study laid out, with breadth, depth, and coherence. I was a mature, responsible adult who knew what he was doing in life.\u000aAs it turns out, the question of "what do I want to do with my life" isn't so easily answered. It's awesome that so many of my friends are sure of what they want to do, and I'm really happy for them, but I am instead in the middle of a conversation with my gut over which words I want written on my diploma.\u000aFortunately for Present-Day Greg, Past Greg did me a huge solid, and said that he would fulfill all of the E:C (that's Engineering with Computing, which is a lot like computer science at a "normal school") requirements in addition to the E:Robo requirements; that way, just in case Any-Point-In-Time Greg got cold feet, it would be okay to switch. With a little careful planning, I bought myself two years to decide between E:Robo and E:C.\u000aA few months ago, after a little soul-searching, I realized that I was much more passionate about computing in general than about robotics in general. There are many computing problems unrelated to robotics which excite me, and there are many aspects of robotics that I don't really care about. So, E:C rather than E:Robo. Problem solved. Right?\u000aWell, now I have a second problem. Now I'm also considering Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) as my major. I plan on fulfilling all of the requirements for both ECE and E:C, so essentially, it's a question of how I want to brand myself: What do I want on my resum? What do I want to tell employers, and more importantly, family members who wonder what I'm up to? How do I want to describe myself to people?\u000aThe differences are subtle. An ECE is considered to be comfortable with both hardware and software. Electrons and pixels, or wires and code, or however else you want to think of it. E:C, on the other hand, goes much deeper into the software, without really dealing with the physical system behind it. Beyond that, the other major difference is that people tend to know what you mean when you say you're an electrical and computer engineer, while if you describe yourself as "engineering with computing," you need to get into this whole discussion about how it's like computer science, but with the rest of engineering as well, and it's an uncomfortable situation.\u000aFrankly, I don't know how I want to answer this question yet. It's tricky, it impacts the rest of my life, and there are many factors to my decision. I'm having the conversation with my gut, as well as with people who know more than me (read as: professors, students, alumni, parents). Fortunately, I've planned out my path such that I don't need to decide for another year and a half -- but it's a question I'm actively wrestling with.\u000a

aV\u000aSo today, I had my only in-class final.\u000aFinals at Olin are interesting.  See, every class has a scheduled final exam time.  However, most project-based courses, like Design Nature, have you submit a project instead of a final exam.  After all was said and done, I ended up with actual exams in only two classes: Math and Physics.  However, the Math final, like some finals in other students' classes, is take-home (yay Honor Code).  That leaves Physics, which I took today from 8 to 11 AM.  Getting up at 7 was no party, but with a healthy night of sleep and a morning dosage of caffeinated tea, it wasn't that bad.  And honestly, the test didn't feel like three hours.  That's not to say it was "easy"; I'm definitely glad I studied.  However, it was written in a way that constantly engaged my brain without overwhelming me.  Nice.\u000a        \u000aAfter that, I enjoyed one of the many luxuries of college life: a nap.  On days when you have to get up early, it's always nice to be able to think, "Oh, I have a nice empty block in my day; I'll take a nap."  Of course, this doesn't ALWAYS happen on early days, but compared to high school, where it NEVER happened, it's quite nice.\u000aBy the time I woke up, it was snowing.  The snow picked up and continued through the entire day. By 10 at night, there were at least 8 inches.  Around that time, I checked Carpediem, the email list where people post various activities and opportunities that are going on.  One of my fellow Power Chords, Erin, posted that she was about to go walking in Parcel B.  Now, Parcel B is a huge plot of land that Olin owns but never really developed; it's pretty much a forest with some trails.  Of course, my brain went, "Deep snow?  Parcel B?  At night?  You bet!"  So I bundled up, met Erin, and off we went.  It was truly an amazing experience, blazing a path through the untarnished snow in the silent woods at night.  Definitely something I'll not forget.  Sure, my feet and legs were caked in snow by the time I was done, but it was worth it.  Being an adventure lover, I felt like a kid in a candy shop.  There's the Olin spirit, folks.  Got a bunch of snow?  Do something.  Want an adventure?  Do something. And so Erin and I took a journey through the snowy woods, and a better way to celebrate the end of my finals I cannot imagine.\u000a-Dan\u000a

aV\u000aIn the midst of shoving almost everything I own into two 25 gallon containers, I finally figured out Olin. When it comes to nostalgia, I'm about as reflective as a lead brick. I wasn't looking back at two awesome semesters when I made my discovery (though they were awesome, difficult, but awesome), I was looking at the giant pile of papers on my desk. Papers that were not going to fit in my storage tubs no matter the amount of shoving, jumping, or duct tape applied. Not too far down in the pile was a journal article on education that solidified my understanding of this college.\u000a        \u000aUntil recently, Olin just didn't "click" in my mind. Sure, I've heard our spiel, Olin is different, Olin is engaging, Olin is hands-on project based learning, Olin is a body of some of the coolest students you will ever meet, Olin is holistic, top-notch, education for a new generation of engineers. Yeah, I love all that, but it just didn't seem to tie together. How was it that building hoppers and children's toys in Design Nature during my first semester contributed to the becoming an engineer for the future? Why the switch back to a few traditional  courses? Why do so many Oliners harp about accreditation and the changes it has made to Olin?\u000aLuckily, I was intrigued by and started reading a paper lying in that pile of dehydrated wood-pulp. The article was entitled Drowning in Method, Thirsty for Values: A Call for Cultural Inquiry by our own Dr. Jon Stolk. Going through the paper I kept reading how the methods for improved engineering education exist, but the values of the people involved were not developed.\u000aValues, needs, goals... people... these are terms all Oliners associate user-oriented design...\u000adesign depth...\u000aSCOPE projects; determining the needs of the liaison...\u000aUOCD (User-Oriented Collaborative Design, an essential part of the Olin curriculum)\u000aAnd then it struck me: Design is the thread the ties Olin College together. Design runs right through the curriculum. Or perhaps more, user-oriented design is the fiber from which this school is built.\u000aHere is how I make sense of Olin. Olin is different from traditional colleges in a multitude of ways, but the foundation of it all is user-oriented design, or perhaps more accurately, user-involved design. Looking back at the facts, it seems obvious; eight years ago thirty undergraduate-age students designed the Olin curriculum. Thirty students. Not graduates, industry leaders, professors, or entrepreneurs, thirty students *. Olin is the amazing college that it is because when the F. W. Olin Foundation started the experiment to advance engineering education, they decided not to do it from the top down. Instead of going to  accreditation organizations, or instating a more rigorous curriculum, they let thirty students determine what they needed in an undergraduate engineering education. To my knowledge, this is the only time this has happened in engineering education.\u000aNow many of Olin's idiosyncrasies make sense.  I started my education here designing swimming toys for children because it is a reasonable introduction to user-oriented design. I will take User Oriented Collaborate Design (another cornerstone of an Olin education) to further understand users, to take context into account, to empathize, design, and make truly relevant products. SCOPE (our senior engineering capstone in which industry partners contract teams of students for real engineering tasks) makes sense, too. There is more to design then end-user product design (UOCD), other stakeholders and engineering firms are the part of most project contexts, and SCOPE makes this real to its participants.\u000aThe occasional dislike of accreditation also makes sense. Nothing seems more top-down than the requirement that we have grades, that all mechanical engineering students take certain core classes, etc. From the users perspective, holding an ABET certified degree opens many doors, but it impinges on some of our experiments.\u000aPerhaps there is too much focus on what Olin is. In terms of being the experiment for engineering education, the way we went about designing ourselves, and the way we continually redesign ourselves is the interesting part. Sure we could be a formula for other colleges to follow, but we could also just spread the design seed that crystallized Olin College. Somehow I think the second option is the way to go.\u000aColin\u000a* Though the Olin "Partners" were not graduates, industry leaders, professors, entrepreneurs, or pedagogy experts, I have to give all these groups due credit. Calls for improved engineering education would not have come without these groups. Olin College wouldn't exist without industry groups like Olin Chemical. Nor is its really fair to say that the Partners alone designed the curriculum; that would certainly shorthand the excellent faculty members the F. W. Olin Foundation brought on board. But I think it was essential for Olin College that the users of the education, students, were highly involved in designing the college.\u000a

aV\u000aZOMG everyone!! I'm very excited. I-am-done. Let me say it again. I-am-done. Sweet!!\u000aAlright, so let me just put this out there: Olin has amazing people, but we're always really busy, so we seldom have loads of time just to hang out. AND NOW WE DO! Expo was this morning, and that went well, but that was my last deadline. Sweet. Now I've got 5 days before graduation to do whatever I want. I was going to go to Cape Cod with some friends of mine, but decided that I'd prefer not to squeeze my packing into one day, and would rather spread my end of the semester obligations over a period of a lot of days, so that I can just unwind.\u000aSo what am I going to do? Learn C++? Read about Greek Orthodoxy? Sleep? Whatever it is, I'm very excited about it. Right now I'm trying to clean out my e-mail inbox (I get a lot of e-mails, and seldom take care of them immediately). I'll finally be able to focus on E-Board (Student Government Executive Board) stuff, after the really intense finals period. Oh, and look! I'm blogging. Wow. *Shock*\u000aFor more of my random summer-esque reflections, please keep reading.\u000aSo what am I doing this summer? I was lucky enough to get an internship up in Gloucester, MA working for Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates. It will be a software internship, which is strange because I have absolutely zero programming vocabulary. My employers know this. I think they just know that I'm an Olin student and can pick up on whatever I need to very quickly. Really, you can totally sell people on the name of this school. I got this internship from our February Job and Internship fairs, actually. It was sweet.\u000aSo yea, I'm living at Olin this summer (that means a 50 miles each way commute, oh boy), which is alright. I'm kind of excited. It won't be the same without everyone else here, but I'll have a few friends. It's going to totally chill. Oh, and the project I'm doing with Varian is so amazing. They need to take the equipment they produce and make a software analog. I will be assisting in taking each of the various parts of the machine, programming in their properties (mmm...object orientation), and making all these parts work together. I'm super excited. So I had to buy a car in order to make the commute every day. My dad helped me out a lot, and now I own a jeep down in Dallas that I'll be driving up. I'm fairly excited about the whole thing.\u000aHmmm...am I missing anything? Oh right, I'm also super excited about the class of 2011. I can't wait until the summer chats start up. If I remember correctly, this is when Senioritis was made far worse by my Olin-obsessiveness. So I expect a lot of pre-frosh to be reading this right now. Hi guys and girls!!\u000aI guess I'll end with some super sweet pictures of my car. Still need to blog about the party. Sorry.\u000a\u000aSweet sweet jeep-age.

aVWhen I was registering for the second semester, people suggested not taking 20 credits and sticking with 16 (4 credits = 1 course). I tried to find the balance while challenging myself by taking 18 credits and flooding my schedule with Co-Curriculars, a Passionate Pursuit, research, and by joining a build team (for our

aV). While it was suggested to us that we take required classes first, I signed up for ones that interested me regardless of whether they were required. I observed a surprising thing; I spent more time travelling and working on projects outside of my coursework the second semester. As I thought more about the reason behind this, I realized how much the first semester helped me to look beyond grades.

aVThis year's Human Powered Vehicle
p898
aVThe fun part of being at Olin and taking classes here is that we do not have final exams. Instead, we have design reviews, mini-projects, sprint reviews and final group projects with a few quizzes sprinkled all over the semester. We do end up working hard on each of these assignments and we also have our share of all-nighters but the work feels so much different from high school. The project topics at Olin are completely open to interpretation, and so is the scope of the project. Having been at Olin for two semesters, I have forgotten how to take tests while learning how to understand a subject by doing it instead of reading about it. The process of unlearning and relearning was possible with the Pass/No Record semester.
p899
aVSo I travelled more, learned more and understood more in my second semester. I spent my spring break volunteering for Habitat for Humanity, building a house in North Carolina. I not only learned about constructing roofs but also about living in sub-standard living conditions. I travelled to California with my build team and learned more about gears and composite in bikes and tricycles. Along with my friends, I went on hikes to near and far away hills. In my research, a team of faculty and students are investigating collective motion of bacteria. My second semester has given me more memories and taught me so much about learning and travelling. At the start of the school year, I would have never imagined to be this relaxed about grades - the Pass/No Record semester at Olin definitely helped me get here.

I have grappled repeatedly with the simple excess of opportunities which is especially intense at Olin. In three years of frenzied activity, classes music sports projects theater conferences everything, I've trained myself to maintain a lot of activity at once. But after taking a complete step out from this Olin pace of life to live in France last spring, my feelings have evolved. I would say now that while I can tolerate the simultaneous pursuit of so many things, I just don't want the over-fullness as much any more. Specifically, I don't want it as much as I want a sliver of space, a margin of clearance around my undertakings. It isn't that I don't value all those many colored blocks that ran so smoothly one to the next last Friday: its that I've grown to appreciate the slack around the edges that leaves time for reflection, for relaxation, for revision, and for randomness.\u000a\u000a\u000aFriday's schedule when exactly according to plan. The only block that got dropped was the very first one. It turned out not to be an overwhelming day: I really enjoyed Systems class and the user interviews for my product design course, soccer practice was relaxed and fun, and then playing a rock show at an on-campus dorm party (which I believe is an Olin first?) was a blast as well. Fulfilling. Overfilling. When I finally found my bedroll at 3 am, I had little left to give. But in the giving I did realize that I'd gotten a lot back.\u000a\u000a\u000aThese are the mixed messages I have to deal with: There's so many great things to be involved in, and taking off a huge chunk of them is in fact really rewarding. But it comes at a cost which I am appreciating more in my senior year.\u000a\u000a\u000aI'm hoping my old friend Lindsay was right when she replied to some long rattling list of my current to-do's. "Well, the good news is, by the time you finish college you'll be set: There won't be anything left that you haven't done."\u000a

It was amazing. Having graduated in December, he's learning French and traveling around Europe now (and applying for jobs?).\u000a        Then, after some worrisome flight cancellations and rescheduling, Ducker ('09) managed to fly all the way out from Seattle to visit me! Imiss talking tech with him -- plenty of people use iPhones and Facebook here, but no one talks about the companies behind the products (or, if they do, I haven't met them). It was good to catch up and show him the city I live in now -- we had fun trying to ignore our fear of heights on Vor Frelsers Kirke, napping on the beach by the offshore wind farm, and barbecuing at my friend's.Using the free Copenhagen City Bikes along the canal\u000a\u000aNow it's time to catch up on my school work here and organize things for Olin next year. I'm terrible at paperwork, and being thousands of miles away doesn't help. I finally got transfer credit for the courses I take here sorted out though (every class I take here is worth just 94% of an Olin class, which is somewhat inconvenient for fulfilling requirements). To receive credit, I need to get the equivalent of a B-. Unfortunately, the Danes use an incredibly confusing 7 step grading system from -3 to 12! We'll see how it all works out :)\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aI was discussing Olin with my family over Thanksgiving break, and, of course, I was required to describe it many times. This made me think of the perfect metaphor for Olin, which is this: oftentimes in history and the media you hear the phrase "the American Dream." This phrase typically refers to a set of ideals that include freedom, trust, and the opportunity for prosperity and success based on hard work. As you are probably aware, America doesn't quite live up to it's name.\u000aOlin, on the other hand, does. Olin is literally the American Dream in a college. Freedom, trust, and success through work: Olin has it all. I mean, you can decide one semester that you want to study--I don't know, Sanskrit--and you can apply for a passionate pursuit in that and get a hundred dollars to help you pursue your study. Talk about freedom to learn. There's freedom to do as well: whether you want to act in a play, sing in an acapella group, be in a photography show, build an anything from any material--you can do all of that here. You can do all of that here with money and support.\u000a                You can be a fire-witch or wizard!\u000a         You can dress up the the entireFireflycrew for Halloween!\u000aOr you can make a bunch of wax sporks that you then turn intosterling silver sporks!\u000aSomething else that I completely adore about Olin is the trust that everybody has. I'm pretty sure that at most schools, students don't just leave their laptops and bags and projects lying around the dorms and buildings--at least not without many of those things disappearing forever. At Olin, I feel completely safe leaving my bag in the Academic Center while I go get lunch, or letting my laptop sit on a lounge table for any period of time. It's Olin: nobody will take it. Heck, last year someone found $20 sitting on the floor in the dorms, and then pinned it to the notice board with a "Is this yours?" message--and the money stayed there for over 2 weeks before it was claimed!\u000aOne of my absolute favorite things about Olin is that, if you really, REALLY want something, pretty much no matter how ludicrous, you can get it or do it. Class is full? If you really can't get in, even after discussing your situation for the professor and our amazing scheduling people, you can still audit the class--and given the size of Olin, when you audit a class you are pretty much absorbed into it after awhile. But actually. But the even bigger thing is this: a story which I have heard from several Olin students. They were not originally accepted into Olin. But after discussing their situations with the staff of Administrations, they were eventually admitted--and are fantastic, wonderful, smart people who fit in well here.\u000aAnd finally, the people here. America--most of the world, really--has a very large proportion of people who just aren't very nice--or in my view, don't want to give away their money. That is not the case at all here at Olin. As I have said, and was informed is entirely accurate: "Our currency is help and everyone is willing to give it away." It's absolutely true. Olin is a perfect society where you can get anything, do anything, or be anything you want and all you have to do is simply be nice and work hard.\u000aOlin: land where the American Dream can finally come true.\u000a

aVHey guys! I'm Erika, one of the new bloggers for the fall 2012 semester. This semester, I'll be studying away in Japan, at the International Christian University just outside Tokyo, in a city called Mitaka. I'll be blogging less about Olin and more about what it's like to be an Olin student in another country, at a liberal arts school, doing non-engineer-y things which will hopefully be just as awesome.
p966
aVI'm pretty excited for that, but in the meantime, I'm finishing up my internship at Boston Scientific, heading to the Cape this weekend, New York City next weekend, and then going home (to the SF Bay Area) to see my 
p967
aVdog
p968
aVfamily, because I haven't been home since January. And then I'm off to Tokyo!
p969
aVIt's taken quite a bit of planning, going back and forth with ICU and Olin, working out financial aid and credit transfer and stuff. I've known I wanted to study away in Japan for a while- since about sophomore year of high school, so I started planning in earnest around the beginning of last year (my sophomore year of Olin) - that's about a semester earlier then people usually do. I'm glad I did start early though, because I was able to plan my class schedule around my semester abroad. Theoretically, I could also have started the actual applications early, but who does that?
p970
aVThere are two main reasons I decided to go in the fall instead of the spring. One, most Japanese schools start in April, so if I'd done that, I would have ended up with an awkward part of a semester free and no summer break. The school I'm going to is an international school, so they have a September start date AND an April start date. The other is that there are too many MechE classes I need to take that are only offered in the spring.
p971
aVThe class schedule is something to be very aware of if you're planning on studying away. You can make it work, but it might mean some ridiculous 20+ credit semesters.A word of caution to anyone who might be planning something similar: If you take 3 of the most time-consuming classes Olin offers in one semester, and then decide you're going to take 2 more classes, get scuba diving certified, have a part-time job on campus, and do research, you'll rack up quite a bit of sleep debt. I'm not saying it's a bad idea, just make sure you have a decent supply of coffee, tea, mate, energy drinks, or whatever caffeinated substance you desire.

aV\u000aHey there,\u000a  This is the last day (actually last five minutes) of Spring Break... I went to North Carolina on a Habitat for Humanity trip with an Olin group of 8 people. Other than learning how to hammer nails into wood, I got two days of summer sun, went to the beach, met a cool NC high school girl, and had fun roof climbing and playing Euchre (Card games with tricks and trumps are the best!)\u000a  Before the break, my team proudly created our first project for mechanical prototyping: Aluminum Tide,a kinetic sculpture of a rolling metallic wave with two steel spheres that orbit synchronously in a perpetual dance of intrigue and mystery. Three years of hard work (actually, one month of intense machining)led us to produce a machine that operates at a speed directly proportional to the rotation of the earth and which emits a sound reminiscent of Rachmaninoff's prelude in G major."\u000a\u000aMy 1st project for Mech Proto: Aluminum Tide \u000a  Since the last post I also discovered the best Japanese Ramen place in Cambridge! The first time you go there, you have to talk about your dream. Jong, who joined my class after serving in military in Korea, said his dream was to "unite North Korea and South Korea". I got the blue sign so I had to talk about 3 dreams, and here they are:\u000a1. Open a dessert shop (preferably on a small plane)\u000a2. Become an Aerospace Engineer\u000a3. Do the above two so I can eat Ramen whenever I want\u000a\u000a"Talk about your dream", Cambridge\u000a\u000a\u000a  Em... It's not just a bowl of ramen; it's your DREAM\u000a   So dear candidates, remember that College is just a mean for discovering, changing and living your dreams. This week as you get your decisions from Olin, be as excited as I was if you get in! There are plenty of opportunites here. Otherwise, don't be too sad because the true gold will shine no matter where it is.

aV\u000aI'd like to start this post by congratulating all the graduating seniors for reaching the final deadline of all college apps. For the non-seniors out there, today (May 1st) marks the nationwide deadline for committing to a college. There's no more worrying about which essays need to be written and which forms need to be submitted. I remember when this day came around, exactly one year ago, I couldn't help but feel bittersweet about the moment.\u000aWhen I put in my deposit to attend Olin College, I wanted nothing more than to celebrate. It was at that moment that it dawned on me that the next four years of my life were figured out. For all of high school, it was always preparing for the next step and trying to get ahead of the game. When will I be taking the SAT or ACT? Are my grades good enough? Will my counselor approve my list of colleges? Did I submit all my forms? When I finally put in my deposit, I felt relieved of that burden and I could live in the moment. I could finally enjoy the next few months, without trying to preempt the next step. It was very comforting to know exactly where I would be for the next four years and not have to worry about what comes next.\u000aExactly one year ago, as a senior, I felt like it would be the last time in my life where I would have absolutely no major obligations. Once I passed my classes, there was nothing left to do except enjoy what I had. I remember cherishing the few months that I'd be living with my parents and the last time my group of friends would be together. This was a really special time. I encourage all of you to take a moment, and consider how unique an opportunity you have before September when you move in. This is the last time in your life where you will have this same kind of transition. Take this time to celebrate who you are and what you've accomplished with your friends and family. Soak it all up, but remember to look ahead.\u000aNo matter how many things are ending (high school, friendships, relationships, etc), there is so much to look forward too. Get pumped! For you all who are attending Olin next year, get ready for the time of your life.\u000a\u000aBuild Day\u000aOn the Olin side of things, as our year comes to an end, projects are finishing up and the work load is at an all-time peak (which is saying a lot given how much work Olin gives its students). I've been busy building a mechanical hand, modeling a human powered helicopter, writing MatLab code to filter images (smoothing filter and edge detection), and building circuits to make a polygraph machine. Yet, in the midst of all this work, tomorrow the Olin Community will join together to celebrate the second annual Olin Build Day. This is a day where students, faculty, and staff all get together to celebrate the community that is a tight family here at Olin. There will be many projects happening around the school which will all help improve identifieds needs and build a stronger bond between students and administration. A few of the activities include "Cooking with Faculty," "Decorating the Stairwells in the Academic Center", and "Developing the Olin Curriculum." Things like this are what make Olin special, and why I'm really enjoying my time here. I feel like I have the space and resources to keep developing the school and improve it in ways that benefit me as a student, and the experience of all the other students at Olin as well.\u000a

aV\u000a        Answer: In Ghana.\u000aFirst, I owe you all an apology-the prep for the end of the year, and this trip particularly more or less took over my life towards the end of the semester, so I have been absent from this blog for far, far too long. But everything did eventually come together, and I hope you will all be happy to know that I did in fact find a place to live for the summer less than 48 hours before leaving for Ghana. When I was having trouble working housing out, I was told "hey, being homeless would be an adventure", but I am somewhat relieved to be skipping that one.\u000aThis semester, I've been in a class called ADE-Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship. The class is a mix of Olin students and Babson students, and we've been working on development-oriented sustainable projects in Ghana, Morocco, India and Alabama. Right now, the Ghana and Morocco teams are in those countries doing some implementation, meetings, interviews, and any other stuff that couldn't happen from a distance. India is meeting up in a few days and Alabama did site visits earlier in the year.\u000aAll the ADE teams that are traveling are blogging here: http://adetravelblog.blogspot.com/Check it out! \u000a

aV\u000aSo I'm not really the type of person that I would classify as "adventurous." I go camping out of a car, I always stay on the road despite owning an off-roading vehicle (much to the displeasure of many of my friends), and I really despise picnics (too many bugs). But then last night came and I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to go exploring with a few of my friends through the 100 acres of woods behind Olin know as Parcel B. \u000aSo here's how it started: I finished up the weekly movie night in my room around midnight and headed over to West Hall to see if anything exciting was happening over there. West Hall, you see, is more vibrant than East Hall because East Hall has suites with their own lounges for chilling whereas all the hang-out-iness of Olin must manifest itself in just three floor lounges in West Hall, giving WH a much higher concentration of cool goings-on per space. Plus West Hall is where all the freshmen live, and everyone knows that the class of 2011 is "the awesome." So I arrive at the other dorm and within minutes my friend Sarah A., an R2 from the class of 2010, comes literally bounding up to me yelling "let's go for a walk, let's go for a walk."\u000aI agree, wondering what the business is going on. After inquiring as to whether my shoes were hiking worthy, which they were, Sarah grabbed Alyssa, Dan, and Nick of the class of 2011 and we were off. Bursting out into what turned out to be a rather stormy night, I finally thought to wonder after the goal of our little excursion. It turns out we were in search of a "body bag" that this group had found on their last trip to Parcel B, so I knew it was going to be an interesting night...\u000a        \u000aWe started off on a path I had not before seen, and before I knew it we emerged on one of the roads that leads to the main entrance of Babson. We continued walking for quite awhile, with Nick constantly trying to scare people and Alyssa threatening to kill him every 30 seconds or so. Sarah, Dan and I just provided the laugh track. We had to keep chatting to ease our nerves, though, because it was really dark and the wind and rain were picking up, making it the perfect beginning for a movie that I couldn't imagine ending well. Plus, we were trying to relocate an object that they could only describe as a body bag. \u000aAs we approached this object's last known location, Sarah suggests we grab a few sticks with which to poke this as-of-yet unidentified object. I, being the smart-alec I tend to be, dive into the woods and emerge seconds later with what my adventure-mates described as "a small tree." Well, I got Dan to help me carry it, and we were off once again. Then we got to the place we'd been seeking: a large rock up ahead with something sketchy looking behind it. I crept up behind it, fully expecting to see the only evidence of the latest hit from the Needham Mafia, and totally jumped back at the sight of a black plastic bag that I swear has a nose and feet! After poking it for awhile with our small tree, we determined that these are just two bags of leaves dumped here and which have protrusions that look scary in the dark. We leave sounder in mind than when we arrived. \u000aSo really, the night should have been over then, but it was actually just beginning. Up until now, we had stuck to roads and paths, but it was now time to pit ourselves against the wilderness and go into and through the woods to find the next great mystery of Parcel B: and old delapidated car out behind Babson's Trim parking lot. Plus, we couldn't stop now, as it had just starting raining really hard. I take the lead and we retrace our steps almost back to Olin before we turn down another path and finally dive into the woods. Almost twenty minutes of "ouch, watch that branch" or "gross, I totally just stepped in a river" ensue. I would even have fallen through what looked like a sturdy bridge over a stream had Alyssa not been there to catch me. After passing a few interesting objects, one of which looked like an alien spaceship, we arrive where we thought the car should be only to find an empty clearing. Sarah and I scramble around looking for this car, because by this point we look like we made the whole thing up, but the freshmen keep faith (I have no idea why) and we keep bushwhacking for another five minutes or so. Eventually Alyssa spots "a yellow light" which turns out to be a reflection off the car's bumper, and victory is had! Thank goodness. \u000aAfter we arrived back at Olin, we took this picture. You can tell it was quite an arduous night.\u000a\u000aThis all ended with a hot chocolate party afterwards, and few of us went to bed before 4. It was great. I would definitely classify last night as yet another successful night at Olin. \u000aThanks for reading, \u000aJeff Moore, Olin College Class of 2010  \u000aP.S. My clothes still aren't dry, and I later had to remove a tick, but it was all totally worth it.\u000a

aV\u000a        It certainly could have become an award-winning nature documentary. The setting: Olin College of Engineering (might as well be our natural environment). Springtime. Birds are beginning to chirp. Rain is beginning to fall. Many are flying south (or wherever home may be), but a few remain in this Boston suburb, left with only their instincts and an adult tricycle.\u000aOur days over spring break were generally carefree...until dinnertime. Like most animals (and like a large proportion of these blog posts), as the sun approached the horizon, all thoughts and all efforts turned to food. Just before our dining hall staff left for the week, the simmering undertones of panic began to reach the boiling point. Stockpiles formed, calls for grocery store runs reverberated through the halls (well, there were a bunch of emails sent, anyway), and suddenly, everything on our meal plan looked absolutely mouth-watering.\u000a        The means of procuring sustenance varied from night to night. Our methods became more sophisticated as the week drew on, but we began as cavemen bashing two stones together haphazardly. We weren't entirely sure of what would happen when we tried to cook on the dorm's stove and weren't about to take any chances. Safety glasses were donned for the preparation of some pierogies that had been sitting in my freezer.\u000aSeveral expectant stomachs complained about the 9:30 dinner time, but were happy to be fed in the end.\u000a\u000a\u000aExpectant......happy!At the conclusion of a progression of take-out and tuna salad, the menfolk decided to light up the grill between the dorms. (Admittedly, the tuna salad was quite tasty.)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOf course, they still made me ride along to the store to do the shopping. This required the use of the tricycle, complete with basket. After a bit of cheese and zucchini drama/debate, we came back and rounded up the troops to prepare the food. Only nine[teen] burns later, we had food! And it was edible. And guess what, Mom! We even ate vegetables.\u000aThe goods.\u000a\u000a\u000aI may not have traveled to exotic locale, but I had a few adventures nonetheless. It's a brutal world out there, survival of the fittest. Engineering students, left to fend for themselves out in the wilderness, will use the tools at their disposal...even if there is nothing more than an oversized trike and some matches. We may not use them in the way they are intended to be used, but undoubtedly, something will happen.\u000a

aV\u000aIt has been approximately 3.006e+6 seconds since fellow Oliner, Brennan VandenHoek, and I pulled out of my driveway in Portland, Oregon and began the round-about sixteen-day cross-country trek (in a VW golf) from the great PNW to the long awaited destination of Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering.\u000aA Road Trip in Pictures\u000a\u000a\u000aHere is the Golf as a very full Golf in Washington.

It is so intensely beautiful there.\u000aBanff National Park.\u000aThis is in Ontario, on Lake Superior. And that is me.\u000aEnd of Road Trip\u000a\u000a\u000aNow that I am at Olin, I can tell you, despite the fact that I spent ten hours yesterday dripping salty tears on my keyboard as I confirmed my personal suspicions of mediocrity via MatLab, Olin is one of the best places on earth.There's my plug.I am so incredibly happy to be here. And....\u000a\u000aYou have no idea how much happiness I derived from this. I've never CADed before.\u000aBut you might be wondering:Who am I? Where have I been? Why am I here?\u000aThese are pretty meta questions, but the answer can be a little less existential; here are the hard facts:\u000aMy name isMikhaelaEleanor (and I don't likemylast name). \u000aFrom Portland, Oregon\u000aI like Firefly, snowboarding, Dr. Martens, good friends, freewriting, free food, free things, free puppies, free radicals, freedom,freeziepops, & freezing cold weather (good thing I am in Boston).\u000aI am really good at being snarky.\u000aI am nineteen going on twenty, an olderfreshman,as I am agappie.\u000aAgappie? What's that? That is an individual who takes a year off between high school and college to do cool stuff like discover their identity and be homeless in Greece. Among other interesting activities, such as getting seriously lost in Moscow with zero language skills, residing for two weeks in old German Police Headquarters, living with Latvian anarchists,couchsurfingthrough seven countries, crossing into the Arctic Circle, and living out of rubbish bins for over a month because I ran out of money.\u000aSeven Months of Traveling in Not So Many Pictures \u000a\u000aBaranovo, Russia.

And so I am taking full advantage of it by hanging out with the upperclassmen in the lofted rooms avoiding adult responsibilities and broadcasting my thoughts on the internet. Ta da!\u000aAnd let that be my segue into the wonderful world of Pass No Record. Quite literally the most brilliant invention in academia since, well, the chalkboard. \u000aPass NoRecord is what allows you to do all the things. Want to be part of REVO, BAJA, OFAC, OPIUM,edisco, Ultimate, SLAC, ODP**, go to all your classes, eat sometimes, go dumpster diving, have friends, shower, compete in the 1-4-1 challenge***, make midnight milk runs, and have Nerf Wars? Every week?Well, you can. Also, please notice sleep was not on that list\u000aI mean, you could sleep if you wanted to, but why would you when there is so much to do?Thusfar Olin feels like summer camp, the only difference is our arts and craft projects have the potential to go seriously wrong. And weroast s'mores! But on a serious note, the community you find at Olin, made by all these quirky dreamers, is unlike anything I have experienced anywhere on earth. No matter what you're interested in there is someone else who is interested, too. Everyone here takes care of one another; I've never felt safer or more accepted for who I am. AtlunchI can sit down with anyone and talk aboutanytopic that crosses my mind. Each day I learn something from my classmates. And within three weeks it already feels as if 72.3% of my class isfamilyand the rest of them are on their way to being good friends.\u000aSo, why am I here? Because this is Olin.\u000aNoreally.\u000aIt's true\u000aAll my love,\u000aMisha\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a*For all you back home, Pass No Record is Olin's version of zero to sixty in what is the automotive equivalent of about two seconds. This way usnoobscan try every club on campus, stay up late getting to know each other and the upperclassmen, get involved in volunteer work, co-curriculars, student activities, run for positions in student government, and generally have a rollicking time. The purpose of it is to get first-years entrenched in the community immediately and give us the space we need to try things we know we will fail at and do just that. Because, after all, knowing how to fail is paramount to true learning, take it from a pro. And yes, being really good at failure is in the skills list on my Resume.\u000a\u000a**In that order: Student clubs for electric vehicles, motor vehicles, fire arts,improvperformance, k-12 outreach, competitive Frisbee, collaborative coding, and all kinds of dance\u000a\u000a***1-4-1 isanOlinventedgame which is when you try to get from the first floor to the fourth, back down to the first and outside of West Hall without ever touching the ground.

aV\u000aHey everyone!\u000a  I wanted to talk about a new group on campus that I am excited to be a part of! The group is called Peer Advocates for Sexual Respect, and it will provide resources and support for survivors, allies to survivors, and anyone else who has questions about consent, sexual respect, and the various resources we have available on and off campus for Olin students. Using similar groups from other campuses as an example, Kate Maschan '15 created this group for her AHS Capstone after she realized that Olin's campus could greatly benefit from it.\u000a  Although we all like to imagine Olin as a completely safe place protected by the Honor Code, it is a college campus, and sexual assaults do occur here just like all other college campuses. Peer Advocates will do everything we can to ensure that survivors are aware of all the resources available to them, while ensuring that they have the freedom to take whatever action they are most comfortable with. We offer unconditional support to anyone who seeks us out.\u000a  The team of 12 students were selected from a large pool of applicants, with a focus on creating a diverse, passionate group that allowed for any student who approached the group to find someone that they could relate to. The diversity of the group also allow for the passions of the team to permeate through many different areas of campus, creating a safer environment for all students. We hope that the team will encourage people to stop perpetuating rape culturethrough rape jokes, objectification, word choice, etc.\u000a  During orientation, first-years will be introduced to the entire team of Peer Advocates, and get the opportunity to ask any questions that they have. Contact information will then be distributed to the students, so they can reach the team whenever they want. The team will then host consent and respect sessions with small groups of first-years where we will discuss ways they can help make campus a safer place while answering questions in a more intimate setting.\u000a  We just finished training two days ago, and throughout training I continued to become more passionate about the topics we discussed. I am already much more aware about how my words and the words of those around me can make a large impact on creating a safer campus for all students. Please don't hesitate to email me directly at charles.mouton@students.olin.edu if you have any questions about the program!\u000aCharlie\u000aP.S. (Random) For the final project for my Robo Class, my team made a "Too Many Cooks" Team Introduction video which is hilarious. Props to Hannah Wilk on editing!\u000a\u000aIt was inspired by "Too Many Cooks" by Adult Swim (Warning: It gets very creepy).\u000a

aV\u000aGreetings from Rome, Italy!\u000aSaturday morning at about 8:30 am (Rome time; it was 2:30 am on the US east coast, from whence I had departed the previous afternoon), I arrived in Rome.  After getting off the plane, going through customs, exchanging most of my remaining US dollars for Euros, waiting for my luggage (two suitcases, each about 50 pounds), checking in with the JCU representatives in the arrival area, waiting for a shuttle, finally getting on the shuttle (we shoved four people into a seat meant for three), and a moderately terrifying ride into the city, we arrived at John Cabot University.\u000a        \u000aI was then handed orientation materials, filled out form after form, got my ID picture taken (I'm sure I looked absolutely lovely after about 12 hours of travel, including running through the Philadelphia airport and sleeping curled up in a ball in my airplane seat), paid my key deposit, signed my housing contract, and was informed that my keys were currently unavailable.  Evidently the locks on my apartment had just been changed, and the keys were being tested.  I had a snack (mmm, croissants), went to the computer lab, got my login credentials, checked my e-mail, re-checked my e-mail, played spider solitaire, and generally wasted about two hours until my keys returned.  The guy who gave them to me - Vincenzo, I believe - informed me that he had spent the entire morning at my apartment building, had gotten several keys re-copied, and he was now satisfied that all my keys were working, more or less.  I was then - finally - taken to my apartment.\u000aThe first thing I did in my new apartment - after letting the neighbors in to have a look around; they chattered in Italian a bit, told me it was beautiful, and left - was pick a bed.  With six to choose from and no roommates to be found, I struggled a bit, but finally picked one with a green bedspread near a window.\u000a\u000a\u000aI considered briefly taking a nap right then, but decided that I needed to arrange some sort of meal for myself for later in the evening.  I got out my map of "Groceries Stores in the Area" (thank you, JCU), and headed out.\u000aI ended up walking three blocks to the grocery store when it was actually only one block away.  I'm evidently not very good at maps, and the Romans are not particularly great at street signs, either.  (Sometimes they're normal-ish street signs, sometimes they're cleverly disguised as plaques on the sides of buildings, and sometimes they just aren't there.)  Nevertheless, I found it (hooray!), and purchased myself some shampoo ("shampoo" in Italian, too), conditioner ("balsamo"), hand soap ("sapone"), tomato sauce (I didn't need my pocket dictionary to figure this one out - there was a whole section of jars of sauce), and cheese tortellini (also, no dictionary required - I've eaten enough Italian food to know which words relate to cheese, and the tortellini part is obvious).  The cashier said a lot of things to me in Italian, which I do not speak, but I just handed her my credit card and that seemed to work out well.\u000aI returned to my apartment and took a nap.  I set an alarm for myself to make sure I only slept for two hours, and I am pleased to report that I only hit the snooze button three times.  I got up and immediately made dinner (the gas stove was a bit of a challenge, but I eventually figured it out).\u000a\u000a\u000aI then figured out which of the wireless internet networks was mine, checked my e-mail some more, took a shower, talked to my parents on the phone (briefly), read a little, wrote in my journal, and went to bed.\u000aI slept for 14 hours.  I was impressed.\u000aThe past few days have been a blur of meeting people and beginning to find my way around the city.  I can now get to the grocery store, the school, the Vatican, my friends' apartment, a department store, and the Colosseum without a map.  Hooray!\u000aEnjoy some miscellaneous photos:\u000a\u000a\u000aThis is a view from my walk to school, the Piazza di Santa Maria in Trastevere.  It's fairly famous, I'm told.\u000a\u000a\u000aMy friend Elle, outside St. Peter's Basilica.  Unfortunately, if you have just lost a leg, you cannot enter the basilica.  So it would seem.\u000a\u000a\u000aA view of a small fraction of St. Peter's Basilica.  I was overwhelmed.  It is absolutely breathtaking.\u000a\u000a\u000aElle and I climbed to the top of the Basilica.  There were a LOT of stairs, and crazy slanting passages, but we made it.  The view was so cool!\u000a\u000a\u000aOf all the things I saw in the Vatican Museum, this map was the most hilarious.  Italy and its immediate surroundings are rather accurate and recognizable, but the further reaches of the world are portrayed most inaccurately.  It amused me.\u000aCiao,\u000aAngela\u000a

aV\u000aWe're all aware that Olin is a fuzzy happy lovely wonderful fantastic idyllic place, but it's definitely, totally, certainly not perfect.  If you spend all of your time on campus, you are almost guaranteed to lose your mind completely.  Personally, I might lose my mind anyway, but I find that getting off campus at least once a week does help somewhat.\u000aThe past two or three weeks, in particular, have been awful.  It's mid-semester crunch time, and almost everybody is stressing out about something - midterms, projects, lab reports, and so on. For example, last Friday my Computer Architecture class met for about 20 minutes, talked about stress, class feedback, where the class is going for the rest of the semester, and a few other things not at all related to computer architecture.  The professor then announced that he'd had a long week, was feeling "beat down and miserable," and that the class was now adjourning to the Dining Hall for a mid-morning, de-stressing snack.  No objections were heard from the students.  We had some juice and muffins and the like and talked about Dubai and ocean surveying and oil and more things not at all related to computer architecture.\u000aSuch was the mood on campus.  It therefore seemed like the perfect time to leave for a little while, and not think about Olin at all.  Thus my good friend David and I left Olin, and in fact left the state of Massachusetts, to go to Vermont and visit an Olin alumnus, Matty.\u000a        Matty lives in Brattleboro, takes classes at a circus school, and works somewhere in New Hampshire as a mechanical engineer.  (In case you were still wondering, yes, he is definitely crazy.  In a good way...) We spent Friday night at his house, met some of his circus friends (a dancer, a contortionist, and a trapeze artist), and played a silly card game that the contortionist had made up himself.  It resulted in, among other things, me getting my face drawn on with eyeliner (no, I am not posting pictures of it on the internet - I don't care how funny it was), Matty having to do handstand push ups, and David bringing the rest of the group snacks.  We all kind of collapsed around 1:00 am; it was a tiring card game.\u000aOn Saturday, we drove north for about an hour, "leaf peeping" along the way (I'm told that's what they call it in Vermont?  Sounds a bit sketchy to me, but okay), and went hiking at Hamilton Falls. We played with cameras for a while - one of my absolute favorite things to do.  I experimented with the manual mode on my camera a little bit, until my battery died.  And then my back-up battery died.  And then Matty's backup battery died.  (Oh well.)  Here are some of the pictures I did manage to take, prior to all the battery death.\u000a\u000aThe Hamilton Falls sign - very epic.  This was, in fact, the only sign on the road (that we saw, at least).  The falls are supposed to be some of the prettiest in New England, and this was the only sign they could manage.  Amazing.  (To be fair, there was actually one more sign a little further along the trail...  But still.)\u000a\u000aMatty and his camera.\u000a\u000aHamilton Falls (and Matty at the bottom).  The longer exposure time makes the water look more like...  Feathers?\u000aWe returned to Olin Saturday evening.  Within two minutes of getting back, I already had a $50 parking ticket and failed dinner plans.  Alas.  Should have stayed in Vermont a bit longer, I suppose.\u000aCheers.\u000aAngela\u000a

You should be able to satisfy all of your shopping needs nearby.\u000aPack smart.  "A really good idea I heard once was this: For a week or two before you leave, keep track of everything you use.

Then you can agree on decorations, who's buying the lamp and who's buying the bath mat, etc.\u000aArriving\u000aRest up.  "Absolutely do not pull an all nighter the night before you show up.  No way in hell."  Also, "Orientation is exhausting."\u000aCall Olin if you have questions.  (Make sure your cell phone is charged.)\u000aBe yourself.  "Be aware of the power of first impressions--have fun, but don't do anything stupid."  Also, "Relax. It's not as scary as you think it's going to be... Above all, don't panic about it."\u000aWorking vs. Playing\u000aASK FOR HELP WHEN YOU NEED IT. Remember: if you're struggling with your classes, you aren't alone. "We were all the best in high school. You won't be the best at Olin. Don't sweat it."  Similarly, "Don't compare yourself to your classmates--everyone here is smart.  Ultimately your work ethic and attitude will matter more than smarts."  And again,  "Ask for help on assignments sooner, rather than later. Everyone else is probably just as confused as you are."  One more time: "There are tutors for pretty much everything - they're all paid to help you, so don't be shy about asking for help."  Got it yet?  No?  "Explore.  Sleep.  Play.  ASK FOR HELP WHEN YOU NEED IT!"\u000aPass/No Record and Time Management: "Appreciate pass/no record (but, please, pass!)--you'll wish you had taken advantage of it more second semester."  (Your entire first semester will be graded as Pass/No Record.  You might get a letter grade for each class, but they won't go on your transcript--just a "P," unless of course your letter grade was not a passing one.)  At the same time, as long as you take time off to relax and enjoy yourself (especially weekend nights), you should be able to get most of your work done at other times, and the practice in time management (and experiencing the Law of Diminishing Returns) is also helpful--one upperclassmen advises you to "try to get into good habits." I found that planning time for myself to relax, have fun, exercise, and/or get off campus helped me be more effective the rest of the time.  Also, make time for sleep--it helps A LOT.\u000aEnjoy yourself.  "Work hard, but not too hard."  Also, "Do something outside of class." Similarly, "Don't worry!  Take at least some time first semester to learn about yourself, not just try to master MATLAB and SolidWorks.  I wish I had.  I think you will be happier in the end."  Basically, we work and play pretty hard at Olin.  Rest up, and tell somebody if you're struggling.  Take deep breaths.  Relax.  Remember that you don't have to be the best to still have an awesome experience and be an amazing person.\u000aSocializing\u000aOn making friends: "Focus on making friends but don't worry if it takes a while to connect with people."  Also, "If you want your room to be a hangout place, start leaving your door propped open.  Your room will attract lots of visitors if the door is open."  Additionally, "It's never too late to come out of your room and start making friends. Even though it may seem like everyone has already found a BFF, I promise that someone at Olin would love to include you."\u000aOn meeting upperclassmen (this is great advice!): "Hang out in East Hall, talk to upperclassmen.  They're excited to meet you."\u000aOn Olincest: "Remember that if you choose to date anyone at Olin (and do), there are only 300 other students here.  Tread softly and leave on good terms."\u000aOn clubs and student organizations: "Don't join every club you see, but keep in mind that most clubs have almost zero commitment and let you in on some optional fun activities once in a while (Japanese club, Tea club, Cheese club, as examples)."\u000aLiving at Olin\u000aLive lightly.  "In the next four years, you will have to move every few months. You will know exactly how many Rubbermaid bins of stuff you own. You will routinely hit the baggage limit if you go by plane, you will try to cram just one more box into your car. My advice is to live lightly. Buy cheap pillows you can throw away at the end of the school year, think about how many books you will seriously read during the year and leave the rest at home with your parents, be wary of picking up every t-shirt that's offered "just because it's free," tell your mom that care packages are nice, but you DO have food here, and that an envelope of cash is infinitely more useful (and cheaper to send) than 12 boxes of EZ-Mac and a few PEZ dispensers she picked up in the checkout line (or maybe that's just my mom?)."\u000aHave fun and be safe.  "Live it up, but don't be stupid.  It's easy to go too far, so watch out." "Don't take yourself too seriously."  "Be flexible, be persistent, live in the moment, get outside, and find a way to de-stress."\u000aPACKING/SHOPPING LISTS \u000aDisclaimer: Please read these lists with a very discriminating eye.  You don't really need any of it (except perhaps pants).  They're meant to be suggestions--things to consider bringing, or buying after you get up here.  Remember, you can always buy more stuff later on.  You'll just probably have more time now.\u000aStuff you should bring to Olin, or buy when you get here (see above for a list of nearby stores; I highly recommend packing as little as possible and shopping upon your arrival)\u000a... For utility and/or necessity\u000a\u000aA computer mouse.  Just get a little USB one; http://www.newegg.com (my favorite technology website) and Best Buy have many options.  Your laptop will not come with a mouse, and working with Solidworks (a design program that you will have to use in your first semester) is much more difficult with just the laptop touch pad.\u000aAn ethernet cable.  Target has them for cheap.  The wired internet connection is much faster than the wireless (though the wireless is quite fast, too).\u000aA floor lamp.  (See the packet Olin sent you for details on which ones aren't allowed first.)  The lighting in West Hall often isn't as bright as you would like it to be.\u000aA desk lamp.  See 3.\u000aA nice mattress pad.  I cannot stress this enough.  The beds are NOT comfortable on their own, and four years of better sleep is worth whatever it costs.  Consider memory foam, even.\u000aBinders, notebooks, pens, pencils.  The usual.  Don't overdo it, though; you can always buy more stuff when you get here.\u000aDuct tape.\u000aPushpins.  Or thumbtacks.  Whatever.\u000aScissors.\u000a2 power strips.  Or squids.\u000a... For convenience (these are the things that are also very useful, but slightly less necessary than the things in the "utility" category)\u000a\u000aAn extension cord.  This is maybe less relevant if your power strips/squids have a very long cord themselves, but may still be useful.\u000aA small toolkit.  It will probably come in handy.\u000aA digital camera with a decent video mode.  This is key for Design Nature (our IT department has video cameras that you can check out if you need to, but it gets a little hectic when all the first year students need them all at once).\u000aA doorstop.  Sometimes the R2s (these are like RAs, only cooler, nicer, and with more tea) get a bunch and sell them for $2 or so, but Target probably has them, and they'll come in handy.  West Hall--your new home--is much more enjoyable and social when you prop your door open.  (Caveat: don't leave your door propped when you aren't in the room.  It's a fire hazard, or something.)\u000aA mirror.  Full-length will come in handy (Target sells them for $6 or so), and a handheld one is nice, too.\u000aSomething to store your bathroom stuff in (especially if you are like me and own a small drugstore).\u000aExtra shelves or other means of organization.  Hangers and the like.\u000aSilverware.  Just a personal set--one or two of each should do.  The more unique, the better: everybody has silverware, and if you get a standard Target set, everybody will have your silverware.\u000aMicrowave-safe dishes.  Crucial for late-night snacking.  Be careful; the ones at Target often are not microwave-safe.\u000aA mug.  Again, unique is better.\u000aA keyboard.  "Nobody likes to type numbers on a laptop keyboard."  Similarly, a spare monitor and laptop dock were mentioned.\u000aAn external hard drive.  Always useful.  Olin students tend to recommend Western Digital above other brands.  (Again: try newegg.com.)\u000aA Citizen's Bank account OR Bank of America account.  There are two ATM's at Babson; both are for Citizen's Bank.  Bank of America has ATM's in nearby Wellesley and Needham.\u000aA trash can.  Every West Hall room gets one trash can and one recycling bin.  It's nice to have spares, because they're small, and you have to share with your roommate.\u000aMini umbrella.  Very handy.\u000a... For personalizing your space\u000a\u000aStuff to make your room feel like home.  A rug, extra pillows, posters, pictures, wall coverings (like sarongs), curtains, holiday decorations, etc.  The room will look very bare and hospital-like when you first arrive; you'll want to personalize it a fair amount to make it feel more welcoming and happy.\u000aLarge pillows, cushions, or bean bags.  For lounging.  Similarly, an extra chair is nice.\u000aVideo game systems and video games.  You will make lots of friends.  :)\u000aEquipment relevant to your interests, possibly including a sleeping bag, hiking backpack, unicycle, bicycle (good for getting to Wellesley/Needham in pleasant weather), musical instrument, etc.\u000aWhiteboard markers.  Every room in the dorms has a small whiteboard outside of it; leave markers and your friends will leave messages.\u000aYour favorite book.  Upperclassmen recommend only bringing one, if any.  For comfort/amusement.\u000aPhotos of home.  "Small, easy, effective."\u000aDecent speakers for listening to music.  The ones in your laptop will be somewhat less than ideal.\u000a... For life in general\u000a\u000aA car, if you have one.  Quoting directly from the survey responses, "Sure there are alternatives, but having your own car gives you unmatched freedom."  Olin is about a mile from the nearest grocery store, and everything else is farther away than that (except Babson).  The nearest T stop (that's the "subway" that goes into Boston; it's above-ground for the first part of the journey) is about a 10 minute drive away from Olin.\u000aLots of blankets and sweaters.  Boston gets cold.\u000aA nice winter coat.  Buy it in the summer; it will be much cheaper than waiting until winter.  I recommend a fully lined one, and the longer the better.  I'm also told that Olin recommends having your winter clothes shipped to you later on rather than bringing them now; this is probably a good idea (space is somewhat limited).\u000aNice party clothes (a dress was mentioned in particular, but I imagine that dresses are less relevant for some).\u000aDressy clothes for presentations and design reviews.  2 outfits was recommended; you could probably survive with one.\u000aPants.  Good advice.\u000aSimilarly, "an equal number of tshirts and pairs of underwear, with an appropriately scaled quantity of pants."  Also good advice.  It's annoying to have to do laundry every __ days/weeks just because you ran out of underwear.\u000aSlippers.\u000aSnacks.  I recommend chex mix, crackers, and dried fruit.  Instant noodles are another popular choice.\u000aStuff you should definitely NOT bring to Olin\u000a\u000aToo many clothes.  Olin isn't going to change the fact that those pants are too short for you or you don't really like that T-shirt.  Also, you will tend to accumulate new T-shirts over time, anyway.\u000aClothes you don't wear at home.  This is essentially the same as the previous point, but it was repeated multiple times over many responses (more than 30% of the responses, in fact), so I thought I'd include it more than once, just in case.\u000aStuff you think you only "might" need.  You can always buy more stuff later.\u000a"Girlfriends."  And boyfriends.  It's generally difficult to maintain serious relationships with people who are not at/near Olin, and this is especially true in your first year.  It's just something to keep in mind.\u000aA bike, unless you use it a lot or really love biking.  Evidently the bike storage room is getting rather full.\u000aLots of books ("who has time for that?"  Also, "The Olin library is pretty good").\u000aHigh school yearbooks and/or sweatshirts.\u000aDesk toys (also mentioned multiple times).  "Desk space runs out REALLY QUICKLY."\u000aA robe ("Whoo private bathrooms").  However, I have a robe and I love it.\u000aExtra computers.  "You probably don't need that extra desktop computer. Unless you like to use it as a dedicated machine for something (like a gaming PC or a server), it's just going to be a gather dust. The same goes for printers - there are laser printers all over campus."  Similarly, "A desktop computer seems like a great idea, and in certain cases it can be very valuable, but it also ties you to your dorm room."  Other responses mentioned not needing an extra laptop, either.\u000aCleaning supplies.  Olin supplies spray cleaners (mild, medium, and strong, I think), toilet paper (and paper towels in the public bathrooms--there's one on each floor in the dorms), garbage bags, and vacuum cleaners.\u000aFurniture.  Olin supplies everybody with a desk, a desk chair, a bed, a set of shelves (or a small set of drawers for East Hall), and a set of drawers.  There's also a new policy about bringing in used furniture (see below).\u000aA Note on Used Furniture\u000aThe used  furniture policy is as follows:  "In an effort to avoid the  health and financial issues associated with a bedbug or other pest infestation,  the College prohibits upholstered furniture from unaccountable places such as  craigslist, town dumps and second-hand shops. New furniture and furniture of  confirmed quality (e.g., from family or close friends) is acceptable. Students  are expected to comply with this ban under the College's core values and Honor  Code. In addition, the often significant costs associated with addressing any  such infestation will be billed to the student(s) responsible for bringing that  piece of furniture into the residence halls." [Student Handbook 2008-09, page  90.]  Note, also, that bean bags count as upholstered furniture.\u000aI hope this was at least moderately helpful.  Good luck with everything, and I'll see you in a few weeks!\u000aCheers,\u000aAngela\u000a

aV\u000aI got an e-mail the other day that I wanted to pass along. It was sent out to all students - the body is copied below:\u000a\u000a"I found a 20 dollar bill in the 3E hallway that fell sometime between 1 and 1:20 PM. It's on my desk if it's yours."\u000aIt's good to see that at five years old, Olin's Honor Code is still going strong. I honestly don't know of too many other places where doing the right thing so completely trumps finders-keepers.\u000aThat might seem like just one random event, but I think it's actually a great example of Olin's Honor Code in action. It's really quite amazing whenever I stop to think about the culture we've developed here. Most of the time, I think we all take for granted just exactly how good we have it. It has almost become cliche to talk about leaving laptops, Wiis or cash unattended in a lounge, and self-timed take-home tests are routine.\u000aI think that's a good thing. It's encouraging to see that integrity and respect are nothing remarkable or out-of-the-ordinary, but simply part of the DNA here. Quite honestly, it's one of my favorite things about Olin.\u000aOf course, even at Olin things aren't perfect. For instance, I'm sorry to report that due to a contingent of Sir Alexander Fleming wanna-bes, the West Hall kitchen refrigerator is going away for a while. But on the whole, I think we've got something special going here - and I hope that's still just as true at the fiftieth anniversary as it is at the fifth.\u000aPicture time!\u000aI haven't gotten out with my camera much due to the long weekend, but I thought I'd post some of my shots of California day, which Jeff so eloquently blogged about last week. We got our first real snow last week, so there have been ample opportunities for slipping and sliding about (I must confess that I'm posting so late in the evening because I went snowboarding today).\u000a\u000a"Chilling" on the Great Lawn\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhoops, no room for your prox card in those trunks!\u000a\u000aLike everyone else, I'm really excited to see some of you at Candidate's Weekend this weekend.

Together!\u000aOlin asks for a bit of money from students every semester (welcome to college, folks!), but student representatives always find a good way to strategically give it back. Each class has a fund to pull from throughout the year, and our reps thought the class might enjoy a ride on the Hunger Games bandwagon, and substantially subsidized the ride using class moolah. The result: a mental break on a Friday night, the ability to talk somewhat intelligently about current pop culture (reaching outside the Bubble, perhaps), and quite the car ride with some classmates.\u000aHere's the group before heading out (photo graciously taken by Jacob '12, an innocent passer-by).

aV\u000aI'm an Olin graduate!\u000aOne week ago today I walked across the stage, shook hands, and received my Olin diploma. I can't even begin to sum up my experiences over the past four years, so I'm not going to try. Likewise, it would be impossible for me to name all the people who helped me to get here and made my journey so incredible and memorable. The best I can do is to say thank you, for everything, to each and every one of you.\u000aThe commencement ceremony had a good dose of the Olin flavor (not too much pomp and circumstance). Student greeter Sean McBride ('07) gave a fantastic speech, by turns touching and hilarious. Professor Allen Downey also injected some humor into his reflections on our time here (a crowd-pleasing highlight was his explanation of the SCOPE program - Seniors Coping with Olin's Preposterous Expectations). Departing Wellesley president Diana Chapman Walsh shared a poem along with her unique perspective on Olin's history and purpose. And David Wurtz ('07) used his alphabetical advantage to lead the whole crowd in doing the wave. If you're so inclined, you can watch the whole thing online (or even download it to your iPod, if you're some kind of Olin superfan).\u000aBefore everyone split up for family dinners, buried themselves in packing up, moving out, moving on - before the onset of "real life", the class of 2007 spent some quality time together. For maybe the first time since our orientation four years ago, we got to simply enjoy each other's company - bowling, riding roller coasters, partying, reflecting, champagne toasting - without all the daily pressures of Olin. These rare opportunities have been my favorite of all.\u000aIn many ways, my time at Olin ends as it began. It was the people - the incredible students, faculty and staff - that brought me here when Olin was just a tiny, unfinished school that nobody had ever heard of. And it is the people that I'll remember most, now that Olin is a tiny, unfinished school that is starting to make quite a name for itself. What I'm going to miss most is all these people I've worked with, played with, lived with, helped build a college with, and come to love. I know they'll go on to do amazing things - indeed, they already have.\u000aSo what about me? In the fall, I'll be starting at Cornell University, working towards a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I'm really excited and anxious to get started on my latest adventure (though not so excited about finding a place to live - anybody know a good place in Ithaca?). In the meanwhile, I'm planning to spend some time at the beach, work on my golf game, and read a good book or two (feel free to post suggestions).\u000aI never would have figured myself a blogger, but it has truly been a pleasure sharing a little piece of my Olin experience with you here. Thanks for reading!\u000aBen Hill (Olin alumnus '07)\u000a\u000a\u000aReady for the real world?\u000a

aV\u000a        So, any perspective college student wonders what a college's dining hall is like. Honestly, Olin's is pretty good. Friends from other colleges have called it great. Unfortunately, as much as I would love to encourage prospective students to look forward to the food in the dining hall, I am taking the liberty to tell people to boycott it.\u000aDitch the dining hall* and study abroad. If you study abroad, then you can do what I do and go on weekend trips to Paris to enjoy the most amazing food and wine ever. It is seriously oh-so-good.\u000aMy breakfast in a Cafe in Paris. That croissant on the right puts the(much raved about) dining hall croissant sandwiches to shame.\u000a*Dear dining hall staff: I love you and everything you do. I am so looking forward to seeing you again in January! This boycott is a one semester thing ;-)\u000a\u000a        I spent this last weekend in Paris with my parents who were visiting me\u000ain Europe for the week. I enjoyed spending time in the city, although I\u000a found it a bit too touristy. I would love to go back, but not too see\u000amore of the Louvre or get another photo of the Eiffel tower. I would\u000alove to go back to eat more. The food was absolutely delicious. I love French\u000acuisine (which incidentally has been recently named a UNESCO world\u000aheritage. Who knew?)\u000aOn Saturday, we went out to dinner with my dad's cousin Maura and her\u000afamily. Luckily, they were able to translate the menu and order for me\u000abecause I can say hello, please, and thank you in French and that is\u000aabout it. I had a French Onion soup (of course!) to start, duck with\u000avegetables and raisin polenta for the main course, and a decadent\u000achocolate dessert. Dinner was phenomenal. The company was great too.\u000aI learned that in French culture the men are supposed to pour for the\u000aladies. I had no problem with anyone filling up my glass with the\u000alovely French wines we were enjoying. =)\u000aOur restaurant on Saturday evening. Verynice and it seemed embody France to me.\u000a\u000aOn lunch on Sunday I had a croque-madame, which is a grilled ham and\u000acheese sandwich with a friend egg on top. It was quite delicious! For\u000adinner, I had a delicious  salmon with a tarragon sauce. Last but not\u000aleast, I had nutella crepes  for desert. I doubt a trip to Paris would\u000abe complete without crepes. They were so yummy!\u000a Showing off the Beaujolais Nouveau and the Nutella Crepes. Wonderful all around.\u000a\u000aWhile in Paris, I also enjoyed some Beaujolais Nouveau, which is a\u000aseasonal French wine. The third Thursday of November is "Beaujolais\u000aNouveau Day" when the wine is released and it's only available for a\u000ashort time. I quite enjoyed it and felt very Parisian drinking it. If I\u000a can find it in the US, I might begin celebrating Beaujolais Nouveau day\u000a annually. =)\u000a\u000aNow that we're both really hungry, I'm going\u000a to go update the Leuven vs. Lima scoreboard. Leuven gets 0.5 points for being two hours on the Thalys from Paris. +1.5 points for all of the glasses of French wine. +3 points for all of the art (I think in this case each piece of art is worth approximately 0.004 points, but I didn't even see the half of it!), +4 points for the French cuisine (a UNESCO world heritage). And +1 point for the French Revolution (1/3 point for liberty, equality, and fraternity respectively). That leaves us with:Lima 35.4 and Leuven 43.9. We'll see what Erika does with her last few weeks abroad! \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aV\u000a So, while all of you are getting read for Candidate's Weekends and just getting used to Olin, Olin students are taking a different step. \u000a Two days last week, and today Olin had mini-Internship Fairs.  These are a new initiative this year by the Office of Post Graduate Planning to expand upon our Fall Career Day.  The great people in PGP but these internship fairs together so that Olin students will be able to connect with potential employers on campus.\u000aThere have been a variety of companies on campus for these events, including GE, Bluefin Robotics, Four Mangoes, and many more.  Companies that hired last years Olin graduates have sent Olin alumni as representatives talk to current students.\u000aThis is just one of the many opportunities right here on campus.\u000a

aV\u000aIf you ever had the privilege of rooting on Olin's own Gui Calvancanti during the first season of the Big Brain Theory, you might remember that the contestants were vying for a contract with the design firm WET, which is famous for designing the Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas. WET's CEO Mark Fuller was one of the judges on the Big Brain Theory - and it is a TED Talk he gave (separate from the show) that I am most interested in.\u000aThe TED Talk was titled "Design DisIntegration," and one of its strongest messages was the idea that an environment which encourages the integration of different people and disciplines is the only environment that will blossom innovation. Watching this talk months ago reminded me so much of the Olin that I knew from conversations with Oliners at Candidates Weekend and Summer Parties, as well as from the stories in OLINsider blog posts and Frankly Speaking articles.\u000aI revisited this TED Talk a week ago, sharing it this time with several reflective first-years, and all of us could not help but confirm the same feelings from our early experiences here. When I think of what it means to be a member of the Olin community, I think of thriving in an environment where integration of ideas and people happens organically and often.\u000aOne of my favorite things I look forward to at the end of the week is a lunch meeting called the Curriculum Innovation Think Tank. The "Co-Curricular on the Curriculum" is hosted by faculty member Jessica Townsend and comprised of an intimate group of students from all four of Olin classes, including one first-year: me! We're a bunch of students who are passionate about discussing how to iron out certain kinks in the academic curriculum, such as figuring out whether we should offer more integrated AHS/ENGR courses that would give our engineering a deeper context (Imagine an AHS Foundation titled "Six Diseases that Changed the World!"). What is so exciting is that Jessica Townsend's position as Associate Dean of Curriculum and Academic Affairs means that our student conversations have sticking power within actual curricular planning. It's not often that an institution takes great care in acting on the combined feedback of both faculty and students on higher-level matters like curriculum change.\u000aThe equal relationship between faculty and student goes beyond the prescribed sphere of academics too. You may be familiar with some of the interactions Oliners boast about, including having a casual conversation in the dining hall with one of your professors or making pottery on weeknights during a faculty member's co-curricular. But are you familiar with ganging up on your professor in a kayak-paddle splashing-war in the Charles River?\u000a\u000aWords can't describe how happy I am to be at a place where I'm not "just a number," where after only several weeks I feel justified in calling the group of advisees and my advisor my advising family, and where a multitude of other brilliant people are on the queue to integrate their personal lives with mine too.\u000a\u000a\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWe spent our Friday night last week slathering paint all over first-year students' white cotton boxers. What'd you do?\u000aAll of the first-year students live in double rooms in West Hall, which means that they historically haven't come over to the suites in East Hall where most upperclassmen live. The Student Activities Committee (SAC) sponsored an event to help change that. Each of the 19 suites was invited to host something entertaining, as a sort of open house to show that we're not as intimidating as it sometimes seems.\u000aMaia, Angela, and I all live in the (somewhat misnamed) Gay Hall, which is comprised of three adjacent suites on the fourth floor of East Hall. It took us a while to decide what to do, but eventually Heena '10 suggested an underwear decoration party. This sounded pretty sweet to us, so we ordered a hundred pairs of boxer shorts, found some art supplies, and hoped for the best.\u000aIt turned out great! What began as a slow trickle of people into our suites became a huge torrent of excited, creative people eager to paint all kinds of designs onto their new shorts. Hardly any paint got on the floor, and when it did we swooped in quickly with cans of stain remover. Here's another shot from the middle of the evening, after a lot more people showed up:\u000a\u000aWe had a great time, and it sounded like everyone who came did as well. It remains to be seen whether the event had a positive impact on the number of freshmen visiting us to hang out -- the fourth floor will always be a relatively long way from West Hall -- but it certainly did a lot to foster goodwill between the first-years and everybody else. Hopefully it'll stay that way!\u000a

aV\u000aLast Saturday morning I woke up to a fantastic realization. I was giving a tour to a group of prospective students on the 50th Anniversary of Doctor Who, a.k.a. "The Day of the Doctor". I rushed to my closet, pulled out scarves, ties, hats, screwdrivers, and more. I could not just give this tour like any other. I finally settled on which of the 11 outfits I would go with (for those of you who don't know, I dressed as all 11 Doctors for Halloween last year), and I ran, scarf streaming in the wind, to Milas Hall, while affixing my nametag to my coat. The admissions office had given me a badge with my name on it in case I forget who I am! Very thoughtful as that does happen. Myself and two other tour guides dramatically made our entrance into the admissions office.\u000aMyself, Mitch Cieminski '16, and Anne LoVerso '17 all prepared to give the Tour of the Doctor\u000aGiving that tour with my friends, all of us probably creeping out some prospective students who had no idea what Doctor Who was, made me realize that it is just as important to be an engineer as it is to not be one. So many Oliners were bonding over this one seemingly ridiculous television show, and why? Because it's something we all love to watch. Sure, we're all dashing about with our safety glasses and laptops and papers, stressing over midterms and projects and for goodness sake why isn't my code working. But that doesn't mean we just have to be engineers. We can be so much more than that.\u000aLook at the community. These Olin students. Consider the day they arrive on campus and blinking step into Milas Hall. There is more to see than can ever be seen. More to do than....no, hold on. Sorry, that's the Lion King. But, the point still stands. We're all here at Olin for a reason. We're here because of our passion, our creativity, not just because we want to be engineers. If we see something we want to change, there isn't anything to stop us from making that change; from taking the lead. This applies everywhere, from the student run teams and clubs who are keeping gardens and putting on plays, to the students who put nice things in the lounges to touch them up, or the ones who have Nerf gun shootouts in the Academic Center. Everywhere you look, students are displaying passion, excitement, and creativity, and not just for engineering. And that, more than anything else, stands out to me.\u000aPeople sometimes ask me what I dream about. Same thing everybody dreams about, I say. I dream about where I'm going. But you're not going anywhere, you're just wandering about, they'll say. But that's not true. I have a new destination, and Olin has helped me find it. This school has shown me that although I am an engineer, I am also so much more than that.\u000aSo where am I going? Here's where. I am going to be brilliant. I am going to be fantastic. And the most important part of it all is that no matter what happens, no matter where I go, I am going to be me.\u000a\u000aAnd that is possibly the most important choice in the universe.\u000a-Alex, c/o 2016\u000a

aV\u000a        It's funny, thinking back a year to this very same time back Senior year of high school. I was stressing out about essays that needed to be written, excited that we were released onto break and we were free to sleep in for longer and not have to do math problems or write essays. Of course, by that time I was also applying to Olin, among other schools ("acronymschools" as Dean of Admission Charlie Nolan would say), and was hearing things back from the places I applied to early. If you're a senior this year, I'm pretty sure you're feeling the same things that I was.\u000a\u000aIt's enough to make someone pull their hair out.\u000a        Here at Olin, I've just concluded three of my four finalactivitiesfor the semester, and I'm in the same state of relaxation, without the need to compose essays on what type of person that I am. It's a nice feeling, exciting and yet kinda sad at the same time. It's weird, but here at Olin it's a different feeling when you're presented with work. I know that I always was in that, "ugh" state of mind as we left Thanksgiving into the short stretch before winter break, but with Olin, I was excited to be back and doing work. That's the magic of college, and Olinspecifically. You WANT to be doing the work you're doing, very deeply, because it's challenging and interesting all at the same time. Most of that comes from the fact that you have more choice, but it's also from the fact that this is a strange and wonderful place, which is different from the normal that you'd get from other places. It's a totally different feeling you have that you just cant get unless you're there for a while.\u000a\u000aWhich brings me to this wonderful series of weeks. By January 1st, I'm sure pretty much every senior will have their essays in. And just a short time later, those wonderful letters will be sent out via overnight UPS to all the awesome candidates with their invitations to candidate's weekend. For those of you that do join us, I'm excited to meet every one of you. Be sure to look for me around and ask me questions, talk with me and other Olin student's about this place we call home, but most of all try to get a feel for the place. Candidate's weekend is not a scripted event, it's an organic way for you to really get a sense for what this place means to all of us, and most importantly to you.\u000a

aV\u000a        Hi folks,I finished my classes a few weeks ago (Chile runs on an "inverted" academic year from ours, where classes start in late July after a short "winter" break and thus end earlier for a long "summer" break) and started traveling into northern Chile, most of which is a very large desert scattered with mines (the mineral kind, not the explosive ones). Which I just got back from and am now luxuriating in a feeling of ridiculous cleanliness resultant from having both a shower and machine-washed clean clothes (at the same time! What excess!)\u000aIt was two weeks of a fairly fast pace-not quite "vacation" in the traditional sense but definitely something I'd do again...in fact, now I keep thinking I need to come back for longer. I didn't even get out of Chile!\u000a        I`m doing most of the classic college-student-travelling things: eating out of a bag of ramen and trail mix, counting anyone I've stayed at the same hostel with two whole nights in a row a close friend, learning that bus drivers can usually find a space for you when the ticket counter thinks there are none and I've even had to count travel time backwards from my current location to figure out what day it is.\u000aI did all of the exploring and stopping while working my way north, so I ended my trip with a 24-hour bus ride from Iquique back to Santiago. Oddly, of all the things-I'm-doing-for-the-first-time I had planned for this trip, this one actually worried me the most (Showing up in strange cities with no plans for food, lodging or travel? No problem. But 24 hours on a bus? What if I get bored? What if the seats are uncomfortable? Are we there yet?). I even almost wimped out and took a flight for the return stretch, but forced myself into doing it with the consolation that if it turned out to be miserable at least I'd know for certain I don't like 24 hour bus rides and avoid them in the future, but I wasn't willing to never know. Of course, it turned out to be fine (Hours 16-20, that stretch where you've been sitting far too long but can't claim "almost there", were less than stellar, but manageable), and I happily arrived in Santiago for the aforementioned glorious shower and a few days of rest before embarking on a similar trip to southern Chile and Patagonia.\u000aOf course, it would be silly to write about study away travel without pictures... \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aAfter I flew home in December, I flopped onto the couch with a book and a mug of tea, and barely got up over the next couple days. It helped that Bellingham, my hometown, was snowed in with an usually large amount of snow, and no one knew quite what to do.\u000aIt was a good thing I got some relaxing time in, because I've been busy scheming and scheduling and having fun since then.\u000aDuring the first week of January, a bunch of Olin students flew in to visit me and go skiing and snowboarding at world-famous Mt. Baker. An *almost* complete group picture of the Olin kids in Glacier - missing Joe '09. From left: Casey '10, Tim '09, Maia '11, Mary '10, Roland, Ducker '09, and Stefan '10\u000aWe rented a cute cabin (with an 8 person hot tub!) in Glacier, WA, and tired ourselves out cross-country skiing, downhill skiing, and snowboarding. We had a great time despite a remarkable number of things going wrong: lost car keys on the slopes, lost cabin keys, hitch-hiking, emergency learning how to put on chains immediately followed by putting on chains, etc. We viewed it as an adventure.\u000aI was sad to see everyone go, but it turns out that it's a good thing everyone left the day they did. Remember all that unusual snow from December? Well, it melted, and the ground became saturated (snow is absorbed more than rainfall is).  Then it rained a lot.  The day I took everyone to Seattle to fly out, there was an avalanche over Mt. Baker Highway on one side of the cabin, and a mudslide that left 6 feet of debris on the road on the other side. Talk about cabin fever!  My mom and little brother were up until 4am sandbagging behind our house; there were 4 mudslides behind our house that night!\u000aMudslide damage behind my houseMore pictures: flooding, mudslide damage to asphalt, my sandbagged house, my yard\u000aI thought I'd be out of the extreme weather when I flew back to Boston on Monday, but Natick has a promising high of 10 degrees tomorrow :( \u000aI came back early to make my Brandeis classes (they start a week earlier than Olin). I've gone to a couple Brandeis classes this week since I haven't decided which one I want to take yet.  I've narrowed it down to Philosophy of Mind, Human Neuropsychology, Visual Cognition, Syntactic Theory, or Chemistry of Sustainability.  It might be hard to believe, but the original list was much longer. And please, if you have any suggestions, let me know... I need to get this figured out before the rest of my classes start!\u000aIn addition to spending lots of time at Brandeis, I've been keeping busy with the "Maia tries to figure out how to buy a car" adventure.  I'm living off-campus this semester in Professor John Geddes' house in Natick while he is teaching in Scotland. Because of that 10 degree weather, I'd rather not bike the 6 miles to and from Olin.  I'm test driving 3 cars tomorrow: a 2000 Subaru Impreza Outback Sport, a 1994 Subaru Legacy Outback, and a 1998 Volvo V70.  I really know next to nothing about buying cars, so navigating Massachusetts' registration and insurance laws should be fun.  If all goes well, I'll have a car (and freedom!!) before school starts.\u000aKeep on truckin',\u000aMaia\u000a

aV\u000aIt's been hard to admit this in some circles, but I am currently unemployed. Not that I didn't try- I applied to a lot of jobs. A lot. A few turned me down nicely- they wanted grad students. A few seemed interested but then things just didn't go anywhere. One or two outright ignored me.\u000aI can't say it wasn't difficult. I basically avoided all this the previous two summers by just working for the same small email company. The last time I had opened myself up to such potential failure was probably when I applied to college, but that ended with eight fat envelopes (and one polite waitlist envelope). I didn't have the same hand of cards I did then; at Olin I am decidedly an average student, nowhere close to the wondergirl I was in high school.\u000aIt made it somewhat easier knowing that others were having difficulties. Some places just weren't hiring interns, and even the smallest companies were exploding with applicants. But one-by-one they seemed to get a perfect job offer. A suitemate working a CERN. A lab partner picking out his new paid-for-by-Microsoft bike. It was hard.\u000aSomehow I didn't give up, even if I felt like it. I don't have a solid plan yet, but I have potential plans. A large corporation (unnamed for now) reserved a few slots specifically for Oliners at the last minute. Despite not being terribly inclined toward software, I sent in a resume and just had my second interview for a designer spot, with the HR talk to come soon. A small wine publication start-up loved me, and while it's an unpaid position, I could get wine and event tickets for revamping their website. A little poking around found an intro to Industrial Design class at RISD that I could take at the same time- possibly in preparation for a Master's down the road.\u000aI went from having no choices to possibly having two great choices. This is a little overwhelming now, but it's a significantly better position than I was in before. I have about a week to decide, but in the end I think I'll have a good summer. I'm just getting all my computer games and wrestling with my dog out of the way now. It might feel late to get things going, but I at least got a lot of relaxation time in.\u000a-Jessi\u000a

aV\u000a By Maia Bittner, 2011\u000aMy move to Copenhagen, despite many logistical difficulties, keeps creeping closer, and I can't deny that I'm nervous. I don't have a clear reason for going, and I feel like I'm giving up so much here. I keep trying to remind myself that I've done this before: I moved by myself to San Francisco, a city I'd never been to and knew no one in when I was just 18. In many ways, Copenhagen should be easier -- I don't need to find jobs or housing like I did in SF.\u000aBut truth be told, I haven't done this before. When I moved to San Francisco, I didn't have a life I treasured near as much as I do now. And so all the wonderful things in my life have become bittersweet, as I can't forget how soon they'll be gone.\u000aFor these awkward 5ish weeks between the end of Olin's Fall semester and the beginning of my study abroad semester, I've been working full-time at HubSpot, the super awesome internet marketing company I started interning with this past Fall. I'm redesigning (and implementing the changes to) a microsite they own, which is dangerously close to my dream job. Dan, Bennett, and I ride the T on January 10th, 2010\u000a        I've been crashing with Bennett ('09), Eric ('08), and Matt (Babson,\u000a'09) in their awesome Cambridge apartment, which is a 15-minute walk to\u000awork. This week, I went to yoga with Matt on Monday, a MITOC Winter\u000aSchool lecture on ice climbing with Bennett on Tuesday, out to dinner\u000aat Baraka Cafe with Eric on Wednesday, rock climbing with Bennett &\u000aDan ('09) on Thursday, and then made mac and cheese\u000awith Matt last night. The boys are all playing in the White Mountains\u000atoday (backcountry skiing I think), so I have the apartment to myself.\u000aI'll join them for a hike tomorrow though.\u000aAnd here I am,\u000apreparing to leave these people I adore, a job I can't wait to go to\u000aevery morning, and activities that make me feel great. I don't even\u000aknow what for, but I'm now coming to see that maybe that's part of the\u000aappeal. So I don't know what I'm going to get out of living abroad. I\u000athink that's ok. I think it will be worth it. And I think it's an\u000aopportunity I'd sorely regret not taking advantage of.\u000a

aV\u000a        I was walking back from the Christchurch Farmers' Market this morning, 2 kg of apples cradled in the nook of one arm and a bulging bag of produce in the other, and I realized that I was long overdue for a blog post. So here are a few reflections on my first month studying away in Christchurch, New Zealand.\u000aTraveling to New Zealand has long been a dream of mine, and I leaped at the opportunity to study away here. The beauty of the natural environment, kindness of the people, and vibrancy of the culture have exceeded my expectations thus far. I love it here both because of and in spite of the differences to my life at Olin. In fact, most of the differences have both 'because of' and 'in spite of' components. Take the size of the University of Canterbury, where I'm studying, for example. I have only recently been able to cut off the 10 minute will-probably-get-lost buffer from my commute between apartment and class. And I still find myself dazed by the sheer number of people everywhere on campus - the 11-floor library is constantly overflowing, the walkways feel like the streets of New York City between class periods, and one of my classes approaches the size of Olin's entire student body. I suppose none of these facts should surprise me on a 22,000 student campus, but the reality of the experience has still managed to jolt me at times.\u000aSession data\u000a\u000a\u000aSession data\u000a\u000a\u000aSession data\u000a\u000a\u000aSession data\u000a\u000a\u000aSession data\u000a\u000a\u000aSession data\u000a\u000a\u000aSession data\u000a\u000a\u000aSession data\u000a\u000a        The benefits of a large university have not escaped me either, however.\u000aThe Tramping Club (read Hiking Club) is 350 students strong and\u000aorganizes several trips every weekend, leaving me to simply pick a trip\u000aand hop in a free seat on Saturday morning to be whisked off to some\u000astunning location. The diversity of students - in academics and\u000abackground - is also incredibly exciting. One of my 'flatmates' is from\u000aFrance, and spending time with her group of French friends creates an\u000aoftentimes perplexing experience (leading me to do things like\u000aaccidentally talk to a bus driver in French as my mind fails to\u000aflip-flop between languages!).\u000aAs most Olin students studying away tend to remark, I feel like I have\u000aa luxurious amount of free time (come final exams, it will probably be\u000aa different story). But for now, it means I can spend my Saturday\u000amorning walking 3 km to and from the farmers' market, go hiking or\u000aexploring nearby areas with friends on the weekend, wander through the\u000abotanic gardens and practice identifying trees for my forestry class,\u000aand talk and laugh away a school night with my flatmates over a\u000amulticultural meal. It means I have time to think about all manner of\u000athings, including ones to which I can't usually dedicate mind space\u000awhile at Olin.\u000aIronically - or perhaps fittingly - these thoughts not infrequently\u000adrift Olin-ward. After all, no matter how much I am enjoying my time in\u000aNew Zealand, I still miss the people, the invested and passionate\u000aprofessors, and the intensity of classes at Olin. A portion of my\u000athoughts continue to be with friends finishing their last semester at\u000aOlin, studying away in places all around the world, or flourishing in\u000atheir post-Olin lives. But I welcome this pulling of the heart and mind\u000ain different directions - it gives this experience an especially\u000acolorful and complex undertone.\u000aA brilliant morning welcomes us as we hike out from our campsite.

aV\u000aHi all! Or should I say, "bye all"?\u000aExciting news! I'll be taking a leave of absence from Olin next semester to go to Brazil to work at a business school called Insper. Insper is in the middle of developing a brand new engineering school, and they have a partnership with Olin. There are four Olin students there now (shoutout to Aditi, Cecilia, Doyung, and Mitch!) designing and developing the first semester curriculum. Myself and a few other Olin students will be swapping places with them this spring, to work on developing second semester classes as well as acting as NINJAs for the incoming students in their classes.\u000aI'm incredibly excited for the upcoming semester and the amazing opportunity at Insper, but it's not without those twinges of sadness. It feels pretty weird to think that I won't be here next semester, especially as classes and clubs are winding down and discussing what the plans are for the spring. Tomorrow is my last day of classes at Olin for almost nine months! I'll miss meeting everyone at Candidate's Weekend, the HPV competition, and taking User-Oriented Collaborative Design with the rest of the class of 2017. It's a lot to think about.\u000aThat said, I couldn't be more excited to go to Brazil. Now that I just submitted my student visa application, everything seems way more real. I'm trying to avoid thinking about all the annoying logistics of international travel (cell phone plans, money conversions, etc) and instead just enjoy my last week and a half at Olin - or as much as I can with all the finals craziness!\u000aSpeaking of which, finals really ARE crazy. I have two projects due next week. In Computational Robotics, my team is making a obstacle course that our Neato robots (sort of like roombas) can navigate through autonomously. It will be able to identify obstacles and figure out what it has to do to complete a "task", like crossing a bridge or knocking down colored dominoes. And in Principles of Engineering, my team is building a piano-playing robot that can read sheet music. It's coming along really well - this video is from our last iteration from two weeks ago, playing Ode to Joy. Now, it can play three octaves, including black keys, and multiple notes at once.\u000a\u000aAnd finally, before I go back to writing my Discrete Math paper, I'll give an update on what I'm sure you all have been wondering most of all - the ball pit purchased by my roommate Haley and I. Well, it's here, it contains 2000 balls, and it is more awesome than we ever imagined!\u000a\u000a- Anne\u000aP.S.

aV\u000aI usually cringe in response to puns, but I just couldn't resist... Hello, I'm Shannon :) I blogged last year, but since you haven't heard from me in a while, I figured a re-introduction was in order. I'm a junior this year. I like to dance. I like to DJ.\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat is that, you ask? Figurines made of Play-Doh. You see, an event called "Suite & Greet" happened recently, and my suite used it as an excuse to buy Play-Doh. Needless to say, we and all of our visitors enjoyed the opportunity to unleash our creative side. We made everything from penguins to PacMan. But Play-Doh has only been a small part of what is proving an enjoyable beginning to the year.\u000a        Even being up before 8 am was made pleasurable by a crisp breeze, the rising sun, and dewy grass that almost sparkled in the morning light as I walked over to Babson College for an entrepreneurship class. This week, I found out that my Passionate Pursuit in west coast swing dancing has been approved, and I went out dancing for the first time since last school year. As it turns out, I haven't forgotten everything about social dancing, and I was surprised at how many faces I recognized and knew. I'm excited to be doing the Passionate Pursuit, since I'd like to start taking formal lessons and competing.\u000aYou know, west coast swing was something I was first introduced to at Olin. Some friends dragged me to the Boston Tea Party, an annual swing dancing convention/weekend, and I found myself unable to leave the westie room. It was music I liked paired with a style of dancing that looked smooth, fun, and similar to salsa (my first love). That weekend, I took as many "Beginner Westie" classes as I could, and I've been doing it ever since.\u000a-Shannon\u000a

aV\u000a-- by Mike Hughes '10\u000a \u000aWith a full week of classes under my belt, I've finally settled back into Olin after spending last spring abroad.  It's great to be back among old friends. One my favorite things about Olin, though, is that some of the people I was excited to see again were not fellow students or even professors.  They were dining hall staff.  And after not seeing me in eight months, they still remembered my name.\u000a\u000a\u000aI've blogged before about how much I enjoy hanging out in the dining hall (I'm writing this post here now).  It's huge and well lit by floor to ceiling windows.  The food is almost always delicious and filling.  But looking back, the biggest draw for me is the people.\u000aThe ladies among the staff always greet me with "Hello Michael!" and ask how I am and how my life is going.  They even made sure to check in with my friends before I even arrived on campus this fall to see if I was still dating my girlfriend , so they would be in the know and not make any awkward mistakes.  They care a great deal about the students here and are always willing to help us find ice for someone who gets hurt on the soccer field or help us get food for a sick roommate.\u000aI also love joking around with the guys who work the grill or the entree sections.  One of my favorite dining hall memories happened two years ago, when a professor made such good friends with one of the cooks that he got to work a lunch shift for a day.  He wore the full chef's outfit (including the sweet hat) and dished out his "special potatoes" to all of the Olin community.\u000aOlin's dining hall staff goes out of its way to make sure they know students' names and really try to be a part of our community instead of just people we happen to bump into everyday.  When I'm lost in the rush of classes and clubs and social events, I really savor the three times a day can come "home" to a delicious meal surrounded by friends, both at my table and behind the counter.  This is one of the huge advantages of Olin's close-knit community, and one of the things I will miss the most after graduation.\u000a

aV\u000aSo Olin, being a small school with a small community, doesn't actually have all that many resources. Yes, we do have $450 Million in an endowment, so we receive most everything we need for our engineering education, but that doesn't mean we are able to hire an entire liberal arts department (though Dr. Rob Martello might make you think otherwise) or build our own athletic center. In fact, we rely heavily on the resources provided to us by our neighboring schools, Babson and Wellesley Colleges, which are adjacent and three miles away, respectively. We also are connected with Brandeis University, but to a lesser degree.\u000aI'll be talking about Wellesley today, and not Babson, for two reasons. The first is that I absolutely adore the liberal arts, while I only have a healthy respect for business. The second is that, as Vice-President of Student Initiatives, I serve as Olin's ambassador to Wellesley, so I'll be talking about Wellesley as much as I want, thank you very much. (That said, if one of the Olin students reading this would like to send me an article on Babson, I would be more than happy to make it an addendum to this post.)\u000aWellesley is quite possibly the coolest place ever. Okay, granted, I swoon over old buildings, long traditions, and the subjects of history, philosophy, and theology, but it's more than that. Because they have a lake! Ok, and I suppose it's more than that, too. For me it provides a perfect complement to the modern, technological beauty of the Olin campus and a nice social extension beyond the Olin people I absolutely adore, but with whom I sometimes have too much in common. Actually, the community of Wellesley is great in its own right, as I have found them to be just as passionate and just as driven as the Olin student body, which is comforting and makes our interactions easier. Of course, it is possible that other students might have had different experiences. [Brief note: this post is, as always, my opinion. And, as always, others reading this blog should feel free to post their own opinions in the comments. However, you should know that we will censor (and have in the past) any comments whose tone or subject matter we feel violate Olin community standards or values. Expect a post on this from me soon.]\u000aI suppose I ought to provide specifics of the Wellesley-Olin connection, rather than just adoring the school in general terms:\u000aFirst, Olin and Wellesley students have the ability to take classes at each others' institutions. I will so be taking advantage of this as much as possible. I'm currently signed up for World Politics next semester, but am on the waitlist of Philosophy of Law. Yay! Last semester almost a quarter of the Olin student body took a Wellesley class. We even had one C/O '07 student, Alex Epstein, petition for and get a shuttle to take students between the schools during academic hours to make cross-registration easier. Wellesley usually sends somewhere between 5 and 15 students our way each semester, but there is a mission this year to bring this number up.\u000aSecond, Olin and Wellesley are starting to branch out socially. Wellesley students have been invited to our parties for some time now, and have even started coming, mostly through the efforts of Man Hall, our mock-fraternity, which has probably done more social connecting between the two schools than any other individual group on campus, save SAC. Wellesley and Olin have also started to share clubs. My personal example is the Babson-Olin Catholic Association and the Wellesley Newman center. We've started to hold bi-monthly game nights with each other and at the end of the year Newman lent us their meeting space in the Wellesley Chapel for our retreat, in which a few Wellesley members were even able to participate. I have also heard that the Japanese clubs are talking, that Olin's Open and Wellesley's Spectrum are on good terms, and that Olin is trying to organize a BABOW (Babson, Brandeis, Olin, Wellesley) Frisbee tournament. One of the most exciting interactions was when a few Olin men and women acted and helped out with the Wellesley production of the play Brigadoon. Oh, and sometimes we have dances together, too.\u000aOf course, being an engineer and an Olin student, the next question is naturally what aspects this design can be improved? Well, this summer I've been working with Sarah Beth Shiplett, a member of the Wellesley class of 2009 who loves Olin as much as I love Wellesley, to develop a comprehensive set of goals for the schools' relationship. Primarily, we are looking to increase the social interaction between the two schools through more club interaction and better relations between the Council of Olin Representatives [CORe] and the Wellesley College Government [CG]. We are also pouring much of our effort into increasing the number of Wellesley students aware of the academic opportunities available at Olin, including the Olin Certificate in Engineering, which basically amounts to their earning a minor in engineering from Olin.\u000aAnd now, as is my wont, I will post some wondrous, happiful pictures of Olin-Wellesley things.\u000a\u000aSo this one is from one of the BOCA-Newman game nights. Don't be distracted by the one Babson student in the picture (BOCA is a dual Babson-Olin club), even though her jacket is super prominent. The other nine women in the picture are from Wellesley.\u000a\u000aThis was BOCA's post-retreat dinner. Even though this was primarily a BOCA event, our relations with the Wellesley Newman center are so good that a few of their members felt comfortable enough to attend and contribute to an event that requires a lot of comfort with the people around you. Two are pictured above.\u000aUnfortunately, that's all I have and, despite searching the Facebook photos of previous Wellesley ambassadors (stern glance at Meena), I cannot find any more good pictures from events I've attended. I need to learn to take more pictures. Really, there's more interaction than this. Really.\u000aAs always, thanks for reading.\u000a-Jeff Moore, Olin College Class of 2010.\u000a \u000a

Admittedly, this is a bit unsettling. During the school year, the dorms are a place to stay up late, working on problem sets and projects, studying until our brains melt. Now, it's my retreat.

aV\u000aWell, I'm three weeks into sophomore year. I suppose I'd better provide some updates. We'll go from most immediate to more long term. \u000aHow I'm spending my weekend: Well Friday night was awesome. On a whim my friends and I went out to a nice Hibachi place in Needham, which was great. Then we got back and it was time to have some fun. My roommate and I host movie nights every Friday night at 9:00PM. We have to compete with people with projectors, but we still like to think we have the highest concentration of cool people of any movie night on campus. =) Last night we watched Paycheck, which I still think is a great movie, but all my friends thought was absolutely horrendous. Well, I guess they're not as cool as I thought. *Wink* We also invite members of the Class of 2011 that we're trying to get to know better, but so far the only one not to be frightened off by East Hall (the more upperclassmen dorm) is my SIBB. Yea, he's that hard core.  \u000aToday was fun. I slept in until 9AM. *GASP* It was quite amazing. I'm behind on committee repopulation (the Vice-President of Student Initiatives is responsible for coordinating the student representatives that serve on the various committees around campus), so I spent some time on that. Then I took a nap (sleep is a precious commodity). Finally, the fun started around 4:00PM. My friends Mike and Alex walked into my room with a mischievous look on their faces and started in: "Jeff, we've heard reports that there's a couch for the taking at the Wellesley dump..." They didn't even have to finish before I'd grabbed my keys and towels for the back of my Jeep and we were off. The couch turned out to be too big, so I drove the cushions and a nice plush chair back to Olin while they resolutely began carrying the couch down the road (the dump is less than a mile away). Well, I rushed back to Olin, unloaded the first trip, grabbed some rolling dollies, and hurried off to the dump again to assist those two oh-so-hard-core guys. I arrived to an ugly scene: the couch was in the middle of the road (the dump was closing, so no one was driving on the coming-in side), my two buddies collapsed on top, looking exhausted. I'd say they'd gone maybe 300 yards. Well, we got the couch on the wheels, and I left to the sounds of the two of them whooping pushing a couch with no cousins and an exposed metal wire frame down the road. It was amazing. I got a ride on the couch while we were going up Olin Way. We got it up to their room and we headed to dinner. \u000aAt dinner I sat with Meena and her friend Anne, which isn't a good idea. They come up with some strange idea when they get together. The short version is that my whole dinner table started singing "Happy Birthday" even though it wasn't anyone's birthday, just to see what would happen. Well, as expected, everyone eventually joined in, and when we got to the part where we should say someone's name, it got dead quite. I love social experiments. It was hilarious! (I promised Meena I would blog about that).\u000aWhat I've been doing for the past three weeks: The beginning of this year was defined by the deaths of Matt and Rachel, which were very hard, and still are in many ways. It shook Olin up pretty bad, and we're only now regaining our footing. For me personally, after I regained emotional stability, I found that, though it seems like it should, the world doesn't stop, and I still had work to do. So that's what I've been doing. \u000aMy classes have been fun. I got into my Wellesley class of choice, Philosophy of Law, and am having a grand old time. I'm actually thinking about going to law school after Olin, but that will have to be a different post. I'm also taking Principles of Engineering which is basically my Olin dream class. Contrary to popular belief, not all, or even most, Olin classes are just "build really cool stuff and see what happens," but this one is that and more. I love it. We've compared with other schools, and it seems that this type of mechatronic project course is only taught at the graduate level of most universities. I'm a sophomore. Finally, I'm taking Modern Physics (which is quantum mechanics and is totally blowing my mind) and Differential Equations (which will become Probability and Statistics at the half point of the semester). The former is hard core, and it will be really fun being able to talk about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (which is actually a formula, FYI) intelligently. The latter is interesting because it is being taught be a visiting professor, and getting adjusted to Olin academic culture is a steep learning curve, but we're helping him along. \u000aReflections on sophomore year in general: Well, I must say that being a sophomore is so totally awesome. For me, it has brought balance to my life. Last year was rough because everything was a new experience, and the Integrated Course Block totally owned my life (being integrated, it is very pervasive). This year I'm spending more time on CORe, working 2-4 hours more per week (I'm an ICB NINJA, which is like a course assistant, but more fun), and I still feel great. I'm pretty sure it is because I'm better at balancing things now and setting my priorities. That, or there's a huge assignment I've forgotten about... On that note, I'm out.  Thanks for reading.   \u000a \u000aJeff Moore, Olin College Class of 2010\u000a

aV\u000a        Well, I'm back as a student blogger for (hopefully!) my final year at Olin College. I went to look through my last two years of blog posts and realized I've never told y'all about my self-designed concentration, which seems quite a gap. So here goes.\u000a\u000aIn less than one year from today (again, if all goes to plan), I'll graduate with a Bachelor's of Science in Engineering with a concentration in Cognitive Science. How cool does that sound? To be honest, I don't have a good grasp on what cognitive science is, and I've never thought "Boy, cognitive science, now *that's* what I really want to study in college". Instead, it seems to be the discipline I've arrived at when I tried to create a program that would both prepare me to be an interaction designer and allow me to take all the courses I wanted to, like Visual Cognition, Tangible User Interfaces, Nature vs. Nuture, Consumer Behavior, and Evolutionary Biology.\u000a After sifting through Olin and its partner institutions' course catalogs, many talks with my advisor, and, admittedly, freaking out about required classes, I came up with my self-designed concentration. Officially, it consists of 7 courses: 2 computer science courses, 2 design courses, 2 neuroscience1courses, and one psychology course2. Olin allows a lot of flexibility with their degrees; for example, before I set out designing mine, I had no idea that my concentration could have AHS (arts, humanities, and social sciences) credits. One of the unexpected benefits of doing a self-designed concentration is that it really required me to think through what I wanted from my undergraduate education and how what I was doing would achieve that (hat tip to Sylvie '09, E:Design major, for helping me recognize this). I love finding out how good design and usability comes from how our brains work, and I'm stoked that Olin will let me make studying this connection my major.\u000a\u000a1.Computational Neuroscience is not longer being offered this Fall, so I'll have to revise my course plan. Thankfully, that's a possibility -- I just have to find a substitute course.\u000a2.Olin's individual degrees are relatively small, sometimes comprising of just 6 courses, since we have more courses that are required for students from all majors to take than most schools do.\u000a

aV\u000aHey there, blogfans! It's been a little while, so I guess I'd better explain what I've been up to. Like most seniors, I've been up to my ears in work for SCOPE. (I also spent a bunch of time last week traveling and figuring out what I'm doing after Olin, but that's a whole 'nother story.)\u000aSCOPE stands for Senior Consulting Program for Engineering. The basic idea is that teams of Olin students work for a full year on engineering problems for corporate partners. Many of the teams are sponsored by companies, but this year we also have a team working with MIT on the DARPA Grand Challenge, and Olin annually sponsors a team to do good (this year working on products for Alzheimer's patients).\u000aMy team is sponsored by Lexmark. We've been working this year on developing applications for their new whiz-bang multifunction printer (the X646e, if you must know). It's a printer-scanner-fax combination device with a large color touch screen and what basically amounts to a small computer inside. The bottom line is that we are for the most part limited only by our imaginations, so it's been a fun challenge.\u000aEven more important than the technical expertise that you gain in the course of the SCOPE program is the work experience. In the SCOPE program, you have to put all those skills you've been learning in your classes to work. You also learn a lot about teamwork, planning, and time-management when you are working on such a large independent project. Fortunately, I've found that Olin has prepared me pretty well.\u000aAnd even though there's a lot of work to be done, our team at least manages to have some fun. At the beginning of this semester, we had traveled as a team to the Lexmark headquarters in Lexington, KY (the horse capital of the world!).  And at our last meeting, we had an animated discussion about my ability to throw fruit (results pictured below).\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOrange you glad I didn't say banana?\u000aOne more senior update: we had a party last night for the entire class, and we got our class rings!\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOlin College class of 2007 rings\u000aThat's all for now. Next week is our spring break, so I'll try to squeeze in some time between lounging and laying about to post again from somewhere warm and sandy!\u000a

aV\u000aAlthough this topic may not be super relevant to those of you who are checking out the blog at the moment, I still wanted to write about my current experience with five courses.\u000aFirst, I am going to review what I was thinking coming into this semester, then explain how it didn't work out the way I was imagining things. Read and be warned.\u000a\u000a                   Me going into this semester.\u000aMy current classes and my logic going into them:\u000aReal World Measurements - Required course and I've heard that it makes Modeling and Control from the Fall semester make sense, which I was excited about.\u000aIntroduction to Mechanical Prototyping - This class I was really excited about because it was a very Solidworks and Mech:E heavy course, and I already knew I was interested in both of those areas.\u000aLinearity I -Required course and I had heard horror stories about the course. I had no idea what to expect going into this course. It was math, though, so it was something that I had never done at Olin before. I was relatively hopeful.\u000aMechanics: Modeling and Simulation Approach - According to Sophomores, this class promised to really strengthen my Matlab skills while getting my physics requisite out of the way. I was looking forward to both of these things. Also, Mark Somerville is an awesome guy.\u000aSoftware Design - I had never really gotten the opportunity to explore the programming side of engineering. I was really excited to learn Python and finally be able to say that I know a language.\u000aOkay, now before I go into details on the pains that have come along with this semester, I will list my current take on my five courses. I also want to say that overall, I have really enjoyed my time here at Olin so far. I am highlighting some of the shortcomings that I was not expecting from a twenty credit semester, but I still have learned a lot from each of these courses and am really looking forward to the courses and adventures that I will experience here at Olin!\u000aMy thoughts on my courses as of now:\u000aReal World Measurements- This course did do a good job of connecting back to Mod Con and filling in some blanks, but I just don't have too much interest in what we are doing because I am more interested in the Mech:E space.\u000aIntroduction to Mechanical Prototyping- This course has been a lot of fun. I have explored new areas of fabrication such as 3D printing and Sheet metal, and it is a ton of fun to have an idea in your head and then see it turn into a solid representation over the course of a week.\u000aLinearity I-This course has been the most trouble for me, because a lot of its curriculum is designed around self-discovery and exploratory learning, and I really have not had the time to sit down and let things click. The concepts are things that I have never seen before and it is a struggle a lot of the time.\u000aMechanics: Modeling and SimulationApproach- This course was approached in a very different way than it was last year, and although that meant less work, we have barely opened up matlab this semester. We look a lot at preparing the system to be entered into matlab, and although this is interesting, it wasn't what I was mainly looking for in the course. Also, similar to Linearity, I have not had the time to really get the most out of the course.\u000aSoftware Design- This course has also been really great. I have really enjoyed exploring the computing branch of engineering and although I had a few hiccups in the beginning with the language, the course has since turned into a type of Software Proto where you have week long projects that feel really rewarding upon competion.\u000a\u000aOkay, time for the issue with five courses if it has not yet been made evident. If you ask an Oliner about five courses, they will warn you about the amount of time that you will have to put towards your coursework. They say that you will have less time to hang out with friends and you will feel really overloaded at times. As we are approaching the end of the semester, I am starting to look back over the semester and realize that I am not taking advantage of a lot of the courses I am in.\u000aBecause you have no extraneous time, you are not able to delve deep into the curriculum of any one class, or in my case, you delve deep into the two classes you are really passionate about, and the rest just fall to the wayside. I feel BAD that I have not been able to really explore the curriculum offered in Linearity or challenge myself to understand all aspects on the labs that we do in RWM.\u000aI just ask that before you decide to take five courses, think strongly about not just how much time you will spend on coursework but also the different ways that this limited time will affect all aspects on your Olin life, including the coursework itself.\u000a\u000a                         Me now.\u000aAnd with that, I say NEVER AGAIN!\u000a

aV\u000a        In case you are wondering what Olin students do when they're not at Olin...\u000aThis summer I'm working for an air-conditioning company just north of Boston, in Woburn - which I have finally learned to call "Wue-burn" instead of "Woh-burn". It's a good group of people I'm working with and an interesting project, so I'm excited to see what will come of that.\u000aI'm living in the city of Boston itself (the North End, to be precise), so one of my major plans for this summer is to spend a lot of time wandering Boston-I've already looked up the free days at various museums.

aV\u000aI had a lot of trouble coming up for a title for this post.  It's mostly (but not completely) about committees I'm on, but that sounds terribly dull.  I've seen the word 'Service' used, but that sounds much more selfless than I know I am.  Fellow blogger Bennett often refers to setting aside time for 'building the college', a phrase I like a lot, but think is a bit pretentious for this particular topic. So, extra-curricular it is - a title I'm not particularly pleased with, but it does the job.\u000aThis work - the work on the Olin that exists outside of classes - is actually what I'm most interested in, and is one of the main reasons I came to Olin.  I like learning about and working on pedagogical issues more than engineering, although I try not to prioritize this work over classwork... usually. So, I'm going to write a lot about some of the things I'm involved in this semester (besides blogging for you guys!) - maybe you'll skim, hopefully you'll find something that you too are interested in. Enjoy!\u000aMembers of the IRC: Caitrin Lynch, Mark Chang, Siddhartan Govindasamy, Maia Bittner ('11), Steve Schiffman and Sarah ('10), discussing creation of a new cross-campus newsletter\u000a\u000aInter-collegiate Relations Committee\u000aI've been newly appointed to this committee, which I think is quite appropriate I be on since I cross-registered for 3 courses last semester and 2 this semester. We've only met once so far, so I don't have much to say, other than I'm happy to be working on the BaBOW partnership.  An aspect that's new to me is trying to educate students at other colleges about the classes and programs they can take here at Olin (I didn't even know we offered an engineering certificate program!).\u000aFaculty Committee for Curricular Effectiveness\u000aI'm the student rep for this committee, which Jon Stolk (my MatSci prof this semester), Lynn Stein (my Software Design prof last semester), Alisha Sieminski (bio prof), Rebecca Christianson (physics prof), and Ann Schaffner (Dir. Institutional Research) are on. It's been fascinating to get an inside look on some of Olin's internal structure to see how things really work. Unfortunately, all the most interesting things are confidential and I can't tell anyone about them!  I can tell you about a couple interesting things we're doing though. \u000a\u000aLast semester, we conducted a student, faculty, and staff survey regarding the state of innovation on Olin's campus.\u000a\u000aWe also organized Expo, Olin's big end-of-the-semester student showcase, last semester and instituted some minor changes from previous years based on feedback we've received. It was really interesting to see how one of Olin's flagship events is put on, since I've only experienced Expo from the student side before. We're also discussing some major changes for future Expos. I've been pretty excited about this - it's refreshing to explore a bunch of different possibilities for Expo that would achieve different purposes or solve some of the problems we have with the current implementation. Should Expo still be required? Should it happen just once a year?\u000a\u000aThe CCE is also charged with reviewing proposals and allocating grants from the Curricular Innovation Fund. I'm nominally a co-investigator with Jon Stolk and John Geddes for a proposal to replace letter grades with a competency-based assessment system next semester in a couple courses.  This is such a rejuvenating and cool idea that I'm almost afraid to get my hopes up in case it doesn't happen!\u000a\u000aFinishing 2006's summer book, The Tipping Point, at a T station before my freshman year\u000a\u000aSummer Book Committee\u000aOne of the longest traditions Olin has is having every community member read the same book over the summer and discussing it in a convocation at the beginning of the year. This year, I'm helping (aka reading a bunch of interesting books and telling other people what I think of them) pick the book for this summer. I love reading, and it's nice to have an obligation to set aside time and read cool books. We initially narrowed the list of 22 titles nominated by members of the Olin community down to Inviting Disaster, The Geography of Hope, This Is Your Brain on Music, and Why We Do What We Do. Since then, we've read the books, hit some bumps, read some more books, and now I think we're trying to nail down a decision by next week so we can order and ship the books to everyone.\u000aStudent Ambassador for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne Partnership\u000aI actually know very little about the Olin-Illinois partnership, beyond what it says in our press release. One of the main ideas behind Olin revolutionizing engineering education is that it would spread beyond Olin (we often talk of "exporting" Olin).  At the President's Council meeting last semester, I was a student assistant for the break-out sessions, where we discussed whether it was even feasible to try the Olin experiment elsewhere, and if so, how best to do it. The main thing us student reps are doing is meeting and arranging accommodations for the 8-10 Illinois students that are coming out for the Engineer of the Future 2.0 summit we're hosting in April. The summit is replacing our traditional "Big Conversations" day (no classes!) so it better be good!\u000aCandidates' Weekend & more!\u000aFinally, this weekend, I'm interviewing candidates at Candidates' Weekend.  Oh, and helping coordinate a couple other activities for CW too - one of which I need to stop by the Wellesley Cheese Shop and pick up a bunch of yummy cheese for.  When Spencer ('10) and George ('10) left to study away this semester, they appointed me in charge of cheese club, so I've been running around trying to do cool stuff for that (we're making fancy mac n cheese with $70 worth of cheese tomorrow!) and submitting line items to CoRe.\u000aOne last thing - On Monday night I went over to President Miller's house for an ice cream social with ~10 other sophomores. There, he told us of all the other sweet things Olin's working on that I haven't encountered in my committees - apparently we've been getting a ton of international interests and are working on forming some partnerships with institutes overseas!\u000aSee you at Candidates' Weekend!\u000aMaia Bittner\u000a

aV\u000aI had to use that title after reading Jordyn's post about being halfway done. I suppose I am also halfway through my Olin career, but surviving this past year signifies 60% completion of my undergraduate career. Scary.\u000a\u000aIt's therefore seems fitting that I have been unable to post an "end of semester" post in a more timely fashion. Yes, exhaustion due to school, packing, traveling, and heat (Tucson likes to hang around the 90-100 F zone this time of year - quite mild, actually) played their part, but I've also been rather busy helping out with my high school's end of year events, most notably senior graduation. It was very peculiar seeing people who were freshmen when I graduated get their diplomas: I officially don't know any current students at Sonoran Science Academy. Way to feel old.\u000a\u000a\u000aBut Ididsurvive the semester! Don't ask me how I got an A- in UOCD, but somehow my team pulled it off. The photo isunfortunatelytoo dark to see what we did, but our final product was essentially a directional megaphone that bikers can use to communicate with other individuals. We noticed that an inability to easily communicate with other bikers, cars, and even pedestrians was compromising many of the positive feelings our users experience while biking. There are already products that try and address this (radios, bluetooth headsets, etc.), but these are fundamentally flawed in that they require all participating parties to have some sort of device, limiting who and when our users can communicate.\u000a\u000aThe beauty of our product (after a long and arduous process of trying to think like marketing people, we decided to call it VoiceBridge) is that it uses parametric speakers to create a "laser beam of sound". This means that I can send a message across a crowded room simply by speaking, but only people in my line of sight will hear it. VoiceBridge uses the volume of the user's voice to control the range of the transmission, the same way that we modulate our voices to talk to those around us. This technology allows our users to send messages to anybody, not just people with a receiving device. This creates some difficulties, such as knowing whether or not a message has been received, plus the obvious possibility for abuse. However, we believe that the ability to communicate so easily (and in such a discreet fashion since the device integrates very nicely into a helmet and has no unsightly wires, buttons, boxes, microphones, etc.) is worth it.\u000a\u000a\u000aTeam Two-Tired at our final presentation\u000a\u000aStuff of History was never exactly stressful, but there was an awful lot of work to do in the closing days. German was interesting - I felt like my oral interview went extremely well, but having to study for an exam is something I haven't had to do for a long time. They both turned out fine in the end.\u000a\u000aThe Film Crew, posing for out photo, taken with aPolaroidcamera. Oh yes, oh yes indeed.\u000a\u000a\u000aBut sadly, this is all that remains of Stuff of History. I think this was the first class I was in where everyone was genuinely sad that the class was over. Thankful that the work was done, but sad that we would not be seeing each other the next day.\u000a\u000aDICEIO was rather frantic right up until the morning of expo. Such is the problem of a team project made up of extremely busy people. I doubt it was the most polished presentation ever delivered at expo, but we were all pleasantly surprised at the number of people who showed up. Not only was there a large faculty contingent, but also a large number of external guests. We weren't booed off stage and people seemed satisfied with the answers we gave to their questions, so we assumed that's a vote of confidence in our model. All the more reason to look forward to next year! If you're interested, there is arecording of our presentation, although the sound quality is sub-par.\u000a\u000a\u000aTeam DICEIO with celebratory post-expo ice cream. Tasty.\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd now it's time to get packing again. I fly back to Olin tomorrow morning so that Sebastian and I can help with the I2E2 Summer Institute. Then after a week of that I'm off to Europe for a 3 week vacation through France and Germany. Oder durch frankreich und Deutschland, man koennte sagen. Highlights include the 24 Hours of Le Mans, a couple laps around the Nurburgring, and the Porsche Factory Tour. More to come over the next month.\u000a\u000aAuf Wierdersehen!\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aIt strikes me that I should have taken a few pictures of the experience I'm about to document... oh well. This past Saturday night, Izzy ('11) and I noticed the sky was particularly clear and the moon had already set for the night. We also remembered that our club, SEDS (Students for the Exploration and Development of Space), had in its possession a reflecting telescope which was practically begging to get out of its box this year.\u000aSo what did we do? Decided to make the night an observation night! We set up the telescope out on the soccer field, far enough away from Olin's buildings that the light wasn't a bother, and began "calibrating" it. This process involved pointing it north, level to the ground, then finding two reference stars. For each of the reference stars (that night, they were Vega and Capella), the telescope would slew to a predicted location, then we would manually correct it until the star was in the middle of the viewing lens. To be honest, looking at stars was not especially breathtaking. While the telescope is nice, we still couldn't see much more than a small, bright dot through the lens. However, once we finished the calibrating, we punched in "Jupiter" (visible for a few short hours after sundown) and watched as the telescope slewed toward a larger, brighter speck, close to the horizon of the mostly-dark night sky.\u000a\u000a          I wish I could say we looked through the lens and saw Jupiter immediately. Alas, the telescope was not perfect in its locating (or perhaps we were not perfect in our calibrating), so we took a few minutes to correct it. Travis ('12) was a natural at this part. Once we had Jupiter in the lens, we sent out an email to the mailing lists carpediem and SEDS inviting people to come out and take a look.\u000aEven though the temperature had dropped dauntingly since sundown, a steady stream of people showed up over the next hour or so. Jupiter provided a much more interesting view than the stars we had been looking at--a small, bright whitish/redish circle appeared through the lens, surrounded by at least 4 smaller pinpricks of light (Jupiter's moons!). I'm not exactly an astronomy guru, but that night, I learned a few more stars than I had known before, and I saw the biggest planet in our solar system through a telescope, as well as several of its moons. So even though it took a good 20 minutes to fully warm up after I returned to the dorms, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We'll have to have many more observation nights...\u000aPeace,\u000aShannon\u000a

aV\u000aEarly in my Olin career, I wrote a set of guiding priorities for my time here, and preferably after. This was in response to realizing I didn't really like the concept of life goals - for me, it seemed too much like "things I won't be satisfied with my life if I don't finish", and I don't know enough about my life yet (if I ever will!) to have that kind of list. On the other hand, I've also found too much aimlessness impairs the pursuit of excellence, and I like having some reference point for reflecting how things are going. The list was an attempt at reconciling both those ideas - it falls somewhere in the middle ground between goals ("If I have done X, I have succeeded") and values ("If I am X, I am successful). They all involve verbs, and they are all evaluated in the present tense ("If I am doing X or currently fulfill X condition, I am currently succeeding"). \u000aI intended all of them to be valid "for a long time" - either forever, or at least for the next large chunk of the future. So I feel just a little old and creaky realizing what seemed like such a large chunk of future has now passed, and I can now check off the first of those priorities to be successfully retired. Woah!\u000a\u000a"No Qualifications" probably wasn't the clearest way of putting this, but what I intended was to not use any "silver bullets", or special requests to be placed on a different team from another individual. I did not find it necessary to use any of them. I have no objection to people using these - in fact, used correctly, they're probably pretty critical to everyone's sanity and the projects' successes. But I'm immensely pleased to have gotten to this point: it required learning to work with a lot of different personalities and working styles, fixing things as early as possible in previous tense teams, and sometimes just apologizing. \u000aSo now the silver bullets, project preferences, skills and majors of the SCOPE students go into a giant algorithm along with each project's requirements, which spits out a bunch of potential team distributions that a human team reviews, and by some time Tuesday the class of 2013* will officially be sorted into teams for this years 14 projects: listed here, along with more information about the SCOPE program in general. Poke through the list - it's a awesome program with an awesome set of sponsors.\u000a*minus a handful doing ADE as capstone\u000a

aV\u000aYou may have heard of this little class called UOCD. If you haven't.....well, you must be new here, so welcome to Olin! UOCD in 30 seconds: pick a group of people (frequent fliers, scuba divers, bike messengers, etc.), spend some time getting to know them as well as you can (in essence, "become" one of them), then identify opportunities forimprovementand think about solutions that your people would actually benefit from. Why? Because bike messengers have a better idea of what a bike messenger would like than you do (unless you're a bike messenger reading this post, in which case I apologize).\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSo that's UOCD. My people group is "People who use a bicycle as their primary means of transportation". Rolls of the tongue, doesn't it? My team has been getting to know bikers (technically not a correct term, but it sure is easier to say) for a couple weeks now, but the get-to-know-people phase is rapidly coming to a close, so it's time to step things up a notch. With that in mind, Charlie, Arjun, and myself undertook the challenge of becoming an urban cyclist in Boston.\u000a\u000aLuckily the three day weekend means a little less pressure on time, but we didn't want to spend the entire day doing one thing. That meant getting up at 8:30 in the morning, the earliest I've got up on a Saturday in months. Of course, we didn't actually get ourselves, the bike, and the car we were driving ready until about 10:00, but no worries. Getting to Boston is surprisingly quick - it's a pity that it takes almost as long to find a parking space. But we were not to be defeated by Boston's lack of free parking! Eventually we found somewhere, unloaded the bikes, suited up, and planned our route.\u000a\u000aArjun\u000a\u000aMe!\u000aand Charlie\u000a\u000a\u000aOut from Cambridge, over the river, into Boston, stop for a spot of lunch, back on the bikes, over the river, through MIT, to grandma's house we go, back to the future the car. I couldpaste in the three or so pages of notes I took about the experience, but I'll just say that it was the most fun I've had in UOCD so far. Anyone who's spent time with me recently knows that I am not the biggest fan of how UOCD has been going, but getting the chance to actually become a member of our people-group, if only for an afternoon, was incredible. Makes me want to bike in Boston all the time! Sure, it was pretty terrifying what with cars and pedestrians and other cyclists, but it was such anexhilaratingexperience that made arriving at your destination so much more of an accomplishment. One of the people we interviewed earlier said they liked biking because it made them feel like they were "...in control of [their] own destiny!" I couldn't agree more! And from a design experience, things that I thought were opportunities (as an engineer studying bikers) turned out to be totally wrong (as a biker, biking). More interestingly, the things that people don't think to tell us (why you need a messenger bag with a quick-release strap, for example) become incredibly obvious after just a morning's work.\u000a\u000aI'm not calling UOCD a success, not at all. But this experience highlighted to me a) that learning-by-doing still works and b) just how hard it really is to put yourself in another person's shoes. Study them all you want, but you'll never think like one until you've become one...\u000a\u000a

In its whirling eddies, a hundred images have rushed by. A smirking Nantaise moon, rushing over a last night of merriment, friends now scattered to many tides. Bright sun on spin-roll-kicking feet: capoeira in manicured parks. The dull glare on tile in a Buchenwald basement: too much death there to comprehend. Lightning flashing on four sides of a window of penetrating starlight in the French central mountains. A crystal blue Boston sky splaying out as a trans-atlantic flight washes in with the ebbing tide of travel. And so have I arrived, rinsed and salted and fresh on the beachhead of Boston. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPart of travel is to make home new again. This change of perspective has made me pay attention- to look at things I might have always overlooked. Suddenly the streets, peoples' clothing, the names of things, the odd colors or garish shapes of advertisements demand observation. It was riveting for weeks, and still is in bursts, this urge for awareness. How American things look, I thought. It is good to be back from France, though staying there would be good, too. I'll call it another door opened during my time at Olin: francophone lands are now within reach, overseas living a viable possibility. I can see the steps to take and anticipate the wash of emotions, going and coming. I'm sure I will leave again, though today I can only guess at the permanence of such a departure. At present, I'm very occupied by Boston living, playing the yuppy as a summer intern, nursing a bank account much abused by foreign fun and exchange rates.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMy place of employment this summer is a compelling one. In a flurry of activity some months ago now, I found, interviewed for, and got a job as the Engineering Intern at Verenium Corporation in Cambridge. I applied because they're a front runner in one of my favorite next-gen biofuels- cellulosic ethanol. I was convinced I wanted to be there, however, by the some 4 hours of Skype-facilitated interviews I managed to pull off from France. This convincing had something to do with my boss, VP of engineering John Doyle. His perspective from 10 years inside this new technology, of working towards a bold potential long met by skeptical audiences, sounded like something I could learn alot from. Six weeks after starting, I'm working a myriad of projects spun off from the activities of the Engineering and Construction group at Verenium's Cambridge office. The company has all the vigor, promise and pressure of a start up, the "aggressive" and often overlapping milestones of an all out drive to develop a technology that they've got a shot at being the first to nail down. But at the same time, it's an organization large and complex enough to expose me to the intricacies of a dense network of working relationships, procedures, and management techniques. It's a fresh take on creation, a new step in the idea-to-impact process that I'm getting to see up close.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPre-ethanol.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIf we could see the roots, this live oak would look a verdant orb.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI suppose my Olin experience has made it seem less surprising that I be unexpectedly sent to Verenium's Pilot Plant in Jennings, Louisiana for on-site, hands-on work learning. The more I get to know my collegues, the smoother the day-to-day experience and the more confident my stride. So far, I've done some mundane work and some challenging work. I've been exposed to a massive influx of how's and why's for an industrial process in mid-invention. I try to keep asking quality questions along the way, keep observing, and foster the same re-entry awareness that pervaded my return from France. It has been satisfying to focus myself on this experience, to be applied after some months of wandering. Now at the half way mark, I'm lining up the more specific (and more ambitious) projects to finish out this last undergrad summer.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEvery week I track down another long-lost comrade, and many of them being from Olin keeps the thought of return, and the finality of senior year, crouched somewhere in the back of my mind.

aV\u000aWhat better way to decompress over spring break than to travel to the most populous city in the U.S.? I might be using a hint of sarcasm. While my trip to New York City was not necessarily relaxing, equally positive adjectives may be employed to describe the adventure: exciting, thrilling, fun, enchanting, energizing...\u000aA few short anecdotes:\u000a        \u000aMy roommate and I learned that NY drivers are much less respectful of pedestrians than Boston drivers... we were literally almost plowed over by a taxi on the way to buy tickets to a show. I harbor no resentment; I always thought it was slightly odd to expect those heavy metal accelerating machines often controlled by distracted cell phone chatterers to stop for me.\u000aWe saw The Little Mermaid on Broadway. The set and costumes transcend description, honestly. I was blown away. While we had wanted to see Chicago originally, I am more than content with the experience.\u000aWe visited both the Museum of Modern Art and the Met. [I should mention that I had somehow never gotten around to visiting NYC before, so all of these activities were exciting, both inherently, and because I had heard all about them from others]. Both of the museums impressed me, although I would like to spend a couple of days more just wandering around them...\u000aWhile I could write more, I need to pack for this weekend's festivities: The Boston Tea Party! It's an annual swing dancing convention outside of Boston, complete with top-notch instructors, hours of workshops, mind-blowing competitions, and dances that last all night. I went last year, and discovered an affinity for west coast swing dancing. Since then, I've gotten the chance to go to dances and practice, so I'm looking forward to being more confident, having more acquaintances in the scene, and dancing, dancing, dancing!\u000aNot to completely ignore the school side of things, I am working on what is quite possibly the most exciting project ever: casting bells in MatSci/Stuff of History. We're using the lost wax casting process to create several small bronze bells with different compositions. Watching the molten bronze pour into our mold from a glowing red/yellow crucible is breathtaking. If I can edit this post later, I'll try to include a picture (we take plenty of them).\u000aFinally, in UOCD, we're in phase 4 of the design process, which brings a second round of visiting our users to talk about some of our rough ideas and involve them in the design process. Since my team is studying chocolatiers, I often find myself taking advantage of the offers to taste-test some of our users' creations. While I wouldn't quite call myself a chocolate connoisseur, I have begun to keep a few truffles on my desk for those times I can't resist a little indulgence. Mmm. I've also completely lost any semblance of taste for Hershey's. Chocolate gets so much better!\u000aThis time I mean it - I've got to leave for the Boston Tea Party in less than half an hour.\u000aHope everyone has a nice weekend!\u000aShannon\u000a

So here I am, a month later, huddled next to a space heater at my grandmother's house 2 hours west of Tokyo in rural Niigata-shi, where I'm staying for two weeks before I go back to the states.

aVSo the first thing I meant to share a little about was ICU sai, ICU's annual cultural festival. "Bunkasai", as these festivals are called, are a huge deal in Japan. Every school has one, and everyone works overtime to prepare for it. I personally didn't really lose any sleep over ICU sai preparation, but I did chop vegetables for several hours. I was in a few clubs, including ICU's scuba club, called ORCA, which was selling these delicious hot steamed buns called "rafutenman." Everyone in the club helped prepare the ingredients, and we cooked them to order on the day of the festival. Or, rather, we received orders and then proceeded to cook them as fast as we could. It started early in the morning, and stayed pretty busy until after lunchtime. The other exchange students and I helped out with the booth for the majority of the time, and then went and explored the festival after. Here's a picture of the booth:

aVOne thing I was surprised about though, was exactly how much people cared about making ICU sai perfect. My experience with ORCA was a lot of fun, but I was in another club (which will remain nameless) that did not go nearly as well. This other club was performing in ICU sai, and, at the last minute, kicked me out, along with the other exchange student. We were told, or actually, the other freshmen were told (while we were also listening) that we (the exchange students) did not look similar enough and that it wasn't good. Granted, we were not necessarily ready to give the greatest performance, and had we been told we weren't ready from the beginning that would have been perfectly ok. However, we'd been told we could participate regardless. Try as I might, I can find no explanation for this kind of treatment other than racism. (It should be noted that the individual who said the most offensive things may or may not have been in the club- I'm still not sure if it was a club member, former member, or someone else.)
p1172
aVAnyway, after ICU sai it seemed like finals came and went in a flash- I slept for some period of time every night of finals week, which is one of my prouder achievements in life. And then fall break started and the ORCA trip to Okinawa! 
p1173
aV20 people went on the trip- 3 exchange students, and 17 Japanese students. It turns out that doing potentially dangerous activities with people you can only kind of communicate with is excellent language practice. And great bonding experience. This is a really long blog post, so I'm going to let the pictures tell the rest.

p1183
aVThis trip was one of my favorite parts of the semester. I made new friends, got to know some people better, saw some awesome coral reefs, practiced Japanese, learned that a lot of fish have really stupid names in English, chickened out of sampling traditional Okinawan sake with a snake in it, saw the second-biggest aquarium in the world and spent a bit more money than I'd meant to on souvenirs.
p1184
aVAnd now I honestly can't wait for Olin to start again. I hate to say good bye to all the people I've met here, and I'm not all too homesick for the suburban US, where stores close at 5pm and convenient public transportation is a nice thought. But I miss my Olin friends, and the Olin dorms, and having interesting classes and projects, and having a dining hall, where food magically appears at 5 pm and empty dishes magically disappear on a conveyor belt. I spent the last semester "cooking" for myself- dining hall food never seemed so awesome.

aV\u000aSo today is that glorious day, April 29th, of no particular significance other than being just moments away from the final day of reckoning: May 1st, when all of the accepted students into classes of 2012 at schools across the country check boxes on forms, hit submit online, or start writing check(s) to secure places at their dream schools.\u000aAnd it was only a year ago that I was in the same position, as, I'm sure, the stragglers left in the crowd. Other sources could confirm for me, but I'm pretty sure at 2 AM on May 1st I left a note outside of my parents' bedroom door saying "I picked Olin," and they put the relevant paperwork in the mail while I was at school [we had pre-filled acceptance forms for all of my "Final Four"]. It took me a month to finalize that decision, while it took others seconds, but I want to share my story to help either those faced with the same decision now, and everyone in the future, so let me back up.\u000a        \u000aI applied to 12 schools, and at the end of the process, I was 8-3-1. I had been rejected by the best, waitlisted by the best, and accepted by the best. Prestigious liberal arts schools, engineering schools, and Ivy League schools all seemed to want me [why, I may never know...]. Although Olin was my first major acceptance, coming in mid-March, it was still a whirlwind of excitement on April 1 checking websites and getting final decisions. But the excitement faded, as I knew I needed to make a choice. Where would I spend the next four years? What did I want to study? What student body, campus, nearby city, and reputation did I want?\u000aI'll skip the details and go straight to the abbreviated story my dad told parents during a panel at Candidates' Weekend 1. Throughout both my brother and my's college processes, he always asked us what our number one choices were. Having learned from my brother's mistakes [;-)], I always told him, "I don't know," or "Here's my top three," all while thinking in my head. But by mid-April, he had me cornered. We both knew it was down to Olin and Dartmouth, so I told him, "You know Dad, I really don't know this time. I keep asking myself how I can pass up a prestigious Ivy League education, only to ask how I can pass up the culture, the students, the academic style, and everything innovative Olin has to offer." I am not sharing this story to market Olin, or to brag about my accomplishments [I assure you, I have classmates who went 24-1 in the college admissions process], but maybe to get you thinking.\u000aThe more I thought about it, and talked to current Olin students, and talked to impartial friends, the two options still remained nearly irrefusable, but a clear path emerged. I knew I would go to Olin, and I knew exactly why, but it was not for any of the direct reasons. I realized, or knew, or decided, that at the end of four years at Olin I would come out feeling accomplished, having been a part of something completely different and innovative that I could take personal investment in. I would come out having worked on countless projects, and I would be unbounded in pursuing things as long as I took initiative. Olin would, and has, allowed me to accomplish anything and everything I want to do. It would give me an opportunity to step out of my comfort zone and be a part of something cool and different. It would be Olin, the community and culture and people that I had experienced at Candidate's Weekend. I knew that after four years I would have felt that my education and experiences at Olin were more rewarding than anything in my life up to that point was.\u000aSupposedly, I am the only one who did not know I would be going to Olin for an entire month. My parents, brother, best friend, childhood neighbors, relatives, and just about everyone else decided I was going to end up here sometime between 2007 and that of April 2008, but no one had told me yet. Obviously, they were right; it just took me a month to make sure it was the right decision. I have loved every experience I have had at Olin, for so many reasons, and cannot imagine having gotten them anywhere else. I can go on and on about how good of a school Olin is and the kinds of amazing experiences one gets here, and how at the end of four years I know I will come out proud, but if I do, you may run out of time to make your decision.\u000aThe reason I wrote this post was to enlighten people on the college decision process. It is not easy, and it does take a month for some people. I came to my decision by thinking about what I would get out of either school, and figuring out which would give me a better experience. For those of you still weighing in on your choices, I want to offer the advice: Just think about what schools can offer you, what you prioritize, and why one school gives you more of an experience or a better education in your interests.\u000aWith that, I bid [some of you] adieu, and wish you the best of luck in making your last second decisions. I cannot wait to see what the Class of 2013 has in store for us next year, and I will see you during Orientation at the end of the summer!\u000aGood Luck!\u000aChris\u000a

aV\u000aHey Everyone!\u000aI am back and here to talk about what I am up to this semester!\u000aI ended up only enrolling in three courses instead of four, which may partly be due to the not fun time I had last semester taking five courses (Check out my old post about that), and this extra time has allowed me to really explore things that happen on and around campus and getinvolved in those things.\u000aOver the summer, I worked with another student and Professor Aaron Hoover and redesigned the Principles of Engineering room. It was really awesome because we got to go through the design process from research to deployable prototype. It has been absolutely amazing to get to see my classmates interact with the room layout and furniture that we designed specifically for them, and to get feedback and see ways that we can continue to improve the space. In a similar vein, this semester, we are continuing to improve the POE room while also shifting focus to improve other areas of campus. The library is a big focus right now because it is severely underutilized by students, and under Jeff Goldenson, our new Library Director, we are aiming to change the library space to fit more needs and attract more students.\u000aAlong with that, I am working two part-time jobs. The first one, on campus, is with the Admissions office. I am in charge of coordinating overnight visits for prospective students. This job has been really great because I have gotten to interact with a lot of prospies passionate about Olin, and connect them with Olin Hosts that share this passion and aim to show the prospies how awesome of a place Olin is.\u000aThe other job I am doing this semester is off campus, in Needham. Another Oliner worked for a workout facility in Needham over the summer and helped them create a webapp that creates a custom workout for its users when they cannot make it to the facility. The company then hired me this semester to help them 'gamify' their app, to keep the users motivated to use the app over the course of months. I will be implementing gaming concepts such as levels, badges, and awards to keep users engaged. This has been a very fun design challenge and it has been great to see what it is like to work in a professional setting. It is pretty awesome to find a job that I was recommended for because I had experience with both athletics and video games.\u000aMoving back to campus, I am doing research in the Intelligent Vehicles Lab. I am working with a small group of students on a Wall-E robot. This robot is primarily a platform to test and research human-robot interaction algorithms, but I am helping to improve the mechanical aspects of the bot. It has been a challenge to come onto a project in the middle, but it has been a great learning experience and I am working under some very smart students that are helping me get in the swing of things. I am hoping to continue to do design and robo research on campus in the future.\u000aThanks for reading! Feel free to contact me at Charles.mouton@students.olin.edu with any questions you have! I would love to chat!\u000a

aV\u000aThough its not completely official, I'm now one of the first of the class of 2008 to know what I'm doing after Olin.  The professor I worked under this summer greatly encouraged me to apply to his department in terms that all but assured admission and a research assistantship. Since I really enjoyed the work I was doing, liked the lab environment, and believed in the value of the project being worked on, it's hard to say no.\u000aHowever the gravity of the decision makes it hard to give a definite yes.  This is a big commitment.  It means another 5 or more years of my life in school, working on the same stuff.  It also means living on a research assistantship while other Olin grads will be raking it in.  Fortunately I'm in engineering - a field where they pay you to go to graduate school.  But more importantly than the money is the opportunities granted by an advanced degree.   If I want to do R&D or become a professor, two vocations I'm interested in, a Ph.D. is pretty important.\u000aGetting this decision out of the way is a huge relief.  Even though I was only a tiny way through the application process, job hunt, fellowship scramble, etc. I was already feeling a little tense.  Its a really time-intensive process and even more so, its really brain-draining.  It was incredibly difficult for me to concentrate on "here-and-now" things when my mind was across the country and a year from now.  I would really advise undergraduates thinking about graduate school to start looking at whats out there as soon as you can.\u000aWith that all said, its time for me do a little catching up on school stuff. . .\u000a

aV\u000aHi everyone,\u000aI was having a little trouble to think of a title for this post, so I looked at the bottom right of my computer, and it displayed\u000a"11:11PM  2/2".\u000aWhat is between these numbers? TIME.\u000aTwo weeks have passed already since the beginning of this new semester!\u000aThere are 24*7=168 hours in a week. I'm taking five 4-credit courses this semester. That means it will take me about 5*4*3=60 hours each week. 9*7=63 hours of sleep and personal hygiene, 2*7=14 hours of meals, 2*7=14 hours of miscellaneous activities, which leaves about 17 hours a week of free time this semester.\u000aWhat does this mean? \u000aThis means that if I spent my whole Saturday having fun with friends (which I did recently - I went to the Museum of Fine Arts, ate hot pot and learned to play HearthStone),I would have no time to play all week. But this math doesn't exactly represent my real life and I'm not complaining, because I like my courses.\u000aMy favorite class is Mechanical Prototyping. I didn't have any experience with Solidworks nor machine shop work before, so everything is new. We did a cool project where we 'designed' our own names already and I got trained on a half manual, half automated mill yesterday.\u000a'Judy' design\u000aWe will eventually design and build kinematic sculptures, like mini versions of the ball orchestra at the Boston Airport (Terminal E). These have been of interest to me for a long time, and recently some of my classmates built one out of sticky notes..\u000a\u000aComplex ball sculpture orchestra at Logan Airport\u000aIn Material Science we are investigating the materials of everyday objects. Our team got to take apart speakers! We are using fancy machines to test materials. After MatSci and Mech Proto, my third 'M' course is 'Markanics' (Mechanics taught by Mark Somerville). It is surprisingly challenging but also interesting. It involves quite a bit of thinking and I got a taste of what a problem set class in college is like- (you don't want to/can't finish them in one day).\u000aOther new fun things I'm doing this semester are Fire Arts Club (I finally joined! Currently swinging pois around), a beekeeping co-curricular (Yeah, beekeeping in the middle of all this snow...but we still saw some small, fluffy yellow creatures) and Chocolate Making Passionate Pursuit! I just ordered my molds and disposable piping bags from Amazon prime:).\u000a\u000aWalnut Pralines!\u000aSo, a fun and potentially exhausting semester ahead of me!\u000aTo all candidates: I'm so excited to see you all! I hope you will like CWs as much as I did. This again reminds me how fast time passes by. Almost one year since my CW already, 350 days, 8400 hours and 504000 minutes.\u000aJudy\u000a

aV\u000aMy apologies for failing to update for so long. With all the pandemonium that accompanies the end of the year and the beginning of the summer, blogging got swept to the side.\u000aSo what have I been doing? Well, I just finished my second full week of work. I feel a little bit like a super hero; by week a worker at a small webmail company- by weekend a Blue Man Group street teamer- she's Jessi!\u000aAnyway, when I told people how much I was working, I got the comment that Oliners really don't let themselves have a break. I would like to reassure you that, although both Ellen and I are working two jobs, that's not the case for everyone. I ended up in this situation in a bit of a weird way. At the beginning of the summer, I had a job that I was hoping to get. When it turned out that I wasn't going to get it, I had to look elsewhere. I searched listings pretty much everywhere; I could have gotten a job, but I wanted an engineering internship. In the end, my pickiness worked out.\u000aI took a weekend job with the Blue Man Group handing out flyers and such, because it intrigued me. Soon after, I decided to ask one of my professors about doing research with her. She didn't have the funding to take on another person this summer, but she asked for my resume and passed it on. I'm now working for a webmail company (with two other Olin students) during the week, mostly on the sales/creative end, but occasionally doing things like software testing. It's a nice atmosphere, and it's rather fun to have both the office job and the run-around-the-city job.\u000aPlus, it's pretty cool to get to hang out in the Blue Man Group's trailer.\u000a

aV\u000a        A few weeks ago, as I reached the summit of one of New Zealand's many stunning mountains, I found myself wondering what the other Oliners scattered around the world were up to at that very instant. This Spring semester, the class of 2011 has an incredible 26 students studying away or taking a leave of absence (LOA). My curiosity piqued, I decided to collect stories from these adventurous souls to create a patchwork of vignettes that begins to describe the range of "away" experiences Oliners seek out. So here are some scenes from the lives of Oliners last Wednesday, changing and being changed by the world...\u000aFor most of us, the memory of preparing to begin our journeys has already faded, but Stan reminds us of the flurry of emotions to which we can all relate: "Less than 14 hours left in the country, and life couldn't be more normal. Here I am, babysitting my first nephew. As I walk around the house, bouncing Joey up and down, I think of how surreal it feels - to be finally leaving for Japan after 3 months of anxious waiting. I'll finally start experiencing the same (or at least similar) experience that all of my fellow study-awayers have already been experiencing for months. Being in a new country, with its own language and culture, how will I cope? How have my friends been coping? Is coping even the right word? I wonder what my friends are doing right now - both back at Olin (which I left only a short 4 days ago) and everyone abroad..."\u000a        A gorgeous Maine sunrise greets Phil as he prepares for another day of\u000awork at The Apprenticeshop. For the past few months, he has been\u000astudying traditional wooden boat building, and his nearly completed\u000askiff shows off his growing mastery of the craft beautifully. It just\u000aneeds some final sanding and a few coats of paint...\u000aOn the other side of\u000athe Atlantic, Katherine begins her day with a jog up to Piazza\u000aMichelangelo, which overlooks the city of Florence. She says, "It is\u000agorgeous to walk up there on a sunny day and see all of the old, unique\u000aarchitecture that you can't find in the states." Her photo speaks for\u000aitself.\u000aTiama is on her way to\u000aclass in Arusha, Tanzania. Her walk takes her directly through the\u000aInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, where they continue to try\u000athe masterminds behind the Rwandan genocide. Normally she would have to\u000aput her bag through a scanner before passing the checkpoint, but as the\u000amachine is broken, she simply waltzes through. Just then, a little three\u000a year old catches sight of her bright polka-dot galoshes, and his eyes\u000awiden with excitement. To Tiama, they were simply a practical response\u000ato the morning's rain, but to this little boy, they are clearly\u000asomething amazing. After pausing briefly to let him examine her alien\u000afootwear, Tiama continues on her way, smiling about the shared but\u000adistinct novelty of the experience for each of them.\u000aAbout 45\u000adegrees further North and using an entirely different mode of\u000atransportation, Sarah is making her way into Istanbul proper for the\u000aday. The dolmus she is riding - the name of these local minibuses\u000aliterally translates to "stuffed" - is living up to its name. She looks\u000aup from her reading (Dear Shameless Death, a novel by Latife\u000aTekin about her experience growing up in rural Turkey) and sees the\u000adriver step out of the dolmus ("right into Istanbul traffic!") to be\u000areplaced by another man who had been sitting behind him. Sarah recalls,\u000a"Just before the door closed I realized I could hear the midday call to\u000aprayer through the open door. The new driver wasted no time in taking\u000aoff, but soon stopped to let a woman in tight, fashionable jeans with\u000ajet-black hair and plenty of makeup onto the bus, while another woman in\u000a a long, dark brown coat with a scarf over her head and another scarf\u000awith decorative fur on the edges wrapped around her shoulders crossed\u000athe street."\u000aIt is lunchtime, and you can imagine the many\u000aexciting foods being enjoyed by these Oliners around the world. For\u000aKatherine, that means a boiled beef sandwich from the Mercato Centrale -\u000a "sooo good!" she asserts. In Pondicherry, CaR is enjoying an equally\u000atypical local meal - "Masala Dosa at a street stall - the epitome of\u000aSouth Indian cuisine."\u000aHaving finished her\u000amidterms, Tiama makes her way home. On the way, she stops to buy some\u000acarrots on the street. The woman selling them tells her it would be 500\u000ashillings (about 37 cents) for 2. Even though she knows the woman\u000aexpects to haggle, Tiama agrees to the price. Walking away, she hears\u000athe woman chuckling with her neighbor about the fact that a muzungu\u000a(white person in Swahili) would pay such a price for just 2 carrots.\u000aIn\u000a Aberdeen, Scotland, Katie's Wednesday evening routine includes a run\u000aaround town with "a group of the coolest ladies in Scotland." After\u000ameeting at the gym, the ladies set out together on their 6.5 mile run -\u000a"a huge mass of neon, spandex, and fashionable running gear heading down\u000a Holburn Street. It was a great run, with a light mist and refreshing\u000abreeze (as only a happy runner could interpret yucky rain and brutal\u000awinds)." Katie remarks, "The coolest thing is that they all understand\u000aI'm not great at hearing people, so they always face me and speak really\u000a clearly. I feel so welcome and happy and look forward to every run."\u000aIn Hong Kong,\u000aKevin is preparing to host a BBQ for students he has met through his\u000auniversity's church group. They arrive from other nearby universities in\u000a Hong Kong and are greeted with food that ranges from "Chinese flavors\u000alike fish balls and other different flavored balls, to Chinese and\u000aWestern flavors like hot dogs (called sausages here, and really\u000apopular), to American specialties like Smores."\u000aReturning to the\u000adelectable world of Italian food, we find Katherine enjoying a\u000acappuccino with classmates before her Italian Language class. This is\u000afollowed by a class on the History of Italian Mafia, which goes until\u000a8:30 pm, at which point it's getting towards dinner time and Katherine\u000aheads to her favorite restaurant for an "amazing personal-sized pizza\u000awith a glass of wine." Dance club follows, with instruction in\u000atraditional Italian dances, and then perhaps a stop at a bar with\u000afriends...\u000aHari, who is taking a leave of absence to work on\u000aprojects in the Cambridge area, is enjoying an evening at Olin. It\u000ainvolves a Sibb family dinner of french toast, expertly prepared by Andy\u000a ('11) with the help of many other cooks in the kitchen. I wish I could\u000ainclude the whole dialogue Hari sent me - it is quite hilarious - but\u000asince this entry is already becoming a saga, I'll simply summarize and\u000asay that despite some dramatic hiccups along the way, the event was a\u000asuccess.\u000aWe finish under the night sky. Megan, visiting Morocco\u000aover her Spring Break from university in Florence, has spent the day on a\u000a camel's back clambering over vast sand dunes. Following a delicious\u000acouscous dinner, prepared by the nomads her group is staying with, and\u000aaccompanied by drumming and dancing, they head out into the evening. "We\u000a climbed up one of the nearby dunes (giving us new-found respect for the\u000a work camels can do) and sat and watched the stars. It was like I was on\u000a another planet, and after returning to Merzouga the next day at\u000asunrise, I felt changed and more at peace with the world."\u000a\u000a

aV\u000a        Glorious day! The sun has arrived and Olin once more teems with energy! Activity abounds when sun-deprived college-aged New England-ers can finally emerge from their dorm rooms and share the air, grass, and sun. A day in march marked the earliest feasible exterior experience. The appearance of students congregating on the great lawn prompted running and jumping. Students walking past returned with frisbees or footballs, juggling balls, sidewalk chalk, and bubble soap. One clever boy (this guy) went and got his camera. In the few minutes of my absence, a lot had happened. My classmates Ariel, Jason, and James had begun performing impressive feats of human stacking, hanging by the ankle from the other's neck and balancing a pair of boys upon one pair of legs! Kelsey had rolled out the hula-hoops and, as always, the poi-kids were a swarm, practicing their maneuvers and tricks.\u000a        Amidst the joyous chaos, several students absorbing the sun and the energy hoped to get some work done on the theoretically dry ground. If they'd had the inclination or foresight, they would have implemented a recent favourite of West Hall residents - transporting couches from the third floor out of the building, laying down extension cables and setting up large speakers to produce what I have dubbed "the Great Lawnge."\u000a\u000aOn another, more recent sunny day, I encountered to the most alluring calves I've seen on campus so far. They weren't the recently unshrouded ankles of my friends. No, these were robotic wonders, harnessed gloriously onto sophomore Colin's legs. Upon 20cm-long springs he hopped, mighty and carefree, leaping and bounding to heights unheard of by mortal men. These contraptions were the result of one club's lobbying many years ago for funding. It was the sole purpose of the Anti-gravity club: to finance the purchase of these spring boots. As, I am sure, were my forbears, I am unswerving in my desire to fly, or at least hop handily. I am certain updates will follow.\u000aThese past few days, I have realized that I finally feel myself again. After being buffeted by the play, visitors, and projects, I am very optimistic about the future. It might be the relief of half-semester courses being completed, or maybe the relaxation of a march break well-spent (in my case, a road trip with five classmates to my home in Montreal), but one thing's for certain. The sunny skies and fresh air aren't hurting my sunny attitude on this fresh new half-semester!\u000a\u000a\u000a

Unfortunately, my room is clean (enough), I've already bought my plane tickets home for Thanksgiving *and* Winter Break, and I can't go running because of the rain.\u000a\u000aBut then I remember that I'm (supposed to be) a student blogger! So here I am, escaping homework. I still have ProbStat on my mind though, so let's talk about it for a bit. \u000aProbability & Statistics, in addition to Linear Algebra, SCOPE, Principles of Engineering, Biology, User-Oriented Collaborative Design, a bunch more I can't remember, and a slew of freshman classes, is one of the courses every Olin student must take to graduate. Rumor has it that Olin has more required courses than your average (engineering?) college, but I don't know if this is true because I've never been to any other college. Plus, it reeks like average college student whining.\u000a\u000a\u000aIn any case, here I am, taking a class I'd probably not otherwise choose to take, because I do want to graduate at some point.\u000a\u000aHopefully, by the end of the class (which is in only 3 weeks, holy jesus freak out god how did that happen this semester just started I need to finish everything can't flip out now, maybe later) I'll even know something about probability and statistics, things I think are useful for everyone to know. Which, some might argue, is the idea behind required classes. So as I think about taking this class, and as I plan the other classes I will take before I graduate, what strikes me is not how many classes I've taken but how few. And I'm becoming a bit alarmed at the idea that this is all I need to have a college degree.\u000a\u000aIf all goes to plan, I'm going to graduate in the spring of 2011 without ever having taken Economics. Or Psychology. Political Science. Sociology. Philosophy. Art. I'll have never taken a college English course, or foreign language, or even chemistry! Don't those sound like useful subjects to know that basics of? Isn't anyone worried about this!?\u000a\u000a(Is this me freaking out about going to an engineering school instead of a liberal arts school? It might be).\u000a\u000aI've always felt that holding a college degree indicates that someone is sort of educated and has a reasonable idea of how the world works, and I don't see how I'll get that in the next year and a half.\u000a\u000aWhere am I going with all this? Should Olin have more required classes? Less? Are other schools any different? I don't know, and I've put off my homework for long enough. Comment if you have any thoughts, answers, or relevant experiences.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPS: I did a whole lot of talking around ProbStat, without really talking about it. The class itself can be rough going at times -- it didn't take me long to realize that the last time I did any math more complicated than algebra was in the spring of 2007, a solid two and a half years ago (see that subtraction there? I'm all over that). The professors, Dr. Sarah Spence Adams and Edward Soares (visiting from Holy Cross), are awesome though. They are trying co-teaching the course for the first time, and they're holding class in the dining hall as an attempt to make up for its 8:00am start time. So cool class, and even though it's not my forte, I don't want to seem like I'm complaining about it.\u000a\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a\u000aAs we bumped away down the red clay road, the children of Offuman village ran alongside the bus, shouting and waving us off. It was impossible not to be struck by the emotional intensity of the moment, having shared the lives of these beautiful people and knowing this was the final goodbye. The opportunity to work with the communities we are designing for has been an incredible part of IDDS Ghana and has visibly leant a richness to the prototypes that are now emerging from each of the 12 project teams. The IDDS organizers established relationships with 10 villages around Ghana, ranging in size from 100 to 8000 people, and we made three separate visits to the villages most appropriate for our projects.\u000aIt amazed me how many deep connections were made in only 9 days spread over the month of working with the villagers. Prior to the first visit, we had received a crash course in Ghanaian culture, which had left my mind swirling with information and nervous excitement. Between the proper greeting protocol, Twi phrases, and social expectations of a woman, I was sure I would commit some sort of egregious error. The first thing we did when we arrived at Offuman was to formally greet the Chief and elders of the community. They sat around the edge of the Chief's courtyard, all wearing gorgeous black and red robes (the colors of mourning - someone had recently passed away) and clasping a handkerchief and cell phone in their hands. Before any verbal introductions could begin, each party had to stand up and greet the other by shaking hands from right to left. Then a bottle of Schnapps was presented to us as the traditional welcoming gift - a symbolic gesture that stayed at the Chief's palace for future guests. We introduced ourselves one by one, and my attempt to use the few Twi phrases I had learned (Me din de Tess; Mefiri America. My name is Tess; I'm from the U.S.) was surprisingly greeted with wide smiles and clapping. It was apparent that they greatly appreciated our efforts to learn their language and understand their lives, and in return we received generous help and advice from many people.\u000a        \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSeamstresses in Offuman village listen attentively to our questions via a translator\u000aBy the end of our third visit, I had met and worked with a cobbler, an aluminum caster, seamstresses, and farmers. I had tried my hand at pounding fufu (the starchy mass made of cassava, eaten at almost every meal), shucking maize, balancing a basin on my head, and then joining in with the good humored chuckling and thigh slapping of amused onlookers. I had stayed up late into the starry night, talking to my host mother and sisters about the differences between Ghanaian and American culture. And I had received a Ghanaian name: Abena Sewaa, with Abena being the name of a Tuesday-born child and Sewaa the surname of my host family. It was a very touching gesture that illustrated the trust and acceptance Ghanaian people offer once they understand your desire to connect with them. And that initial connection need be nothing more than a simple "Ma akwye" (Good morning). Guarded expressions quickly leap into a grin, and the response may vary from "Ete sen?" (How are you?) to "I like you - will you be my friend?" to "Are you married?" Friends are made very quickly in Ghana if you open your heart to these people.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMy host sisters prepare fufu in a perfect dance of kneading and pounding\u000aOur many and diverse interactions enabled us to truly understand the design challenges we are working on. Between the first and third visits, we went from only a basic sense of the project to working prototypes we were able to show and use with the villagers. In the case of my project, we began with the extremely broad goal of 'turning plastic waste into products appropriate and useful to rural villages' and ended with a waste plastic sheet-making machine and an extensive line of plastic products. It was an exciting and rewarding experience to see the many ideas and insightful pieces of advice come together into a tangible prototype.\u000aNow we are preparing for our final presentations, which will take place at the Kwame Nkrumah University of  Science and Technology (KNUST) where we have been staying in between village visits and working on our projects. So we are racing to the finish, working late into the nights on our prototypes and posters and reports. Since this entry is already rather long, I will save the details of my project and final prototype for an entry in the near future. This last week will certainly be filled with more moments that blur the vision and tighten the chest with emotion, but the myriad connections made here promise to extend into the future and offer more opportunities to teach and be taught.\u000a- TESS\u000a

aV\u000a        Summer continues happily on here in Boston, and I hope wherever you all are as well. I have no particularly pressing obligations or must-achieve goals for the summer, and I must say it's excellent. Olin continually pushes me to be a little better than I thought I could be (a more critical thinker, more open-minded, more organized, a bolder designer, a more technical engineer, etc.), and I love it for that, but there's something immensely refreshing about operating a little "below potential". I'm not advocating skating through life, but I'm tossing around the hypothesis continually operating at the outer limit (or even a bit beyond) of one's capability precludes a certain type of percolating thinking that can only be done slowly and not terribly efficiently. It might be like the intellectual equivalent of never taking a rest day after a hard workout. I haven't quite worked out all the edges of this particular hypothesis though, and I'd love to hear arguments for or against. \u000aRegardless, my life is now pleasantly full of normal working hours, swimming, cooking large pots of rice pudding just because I can, walking through Boston, and coveting the sailboats along the harbor.\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aAndrea ('13) and myself at a beach near Salem, MA.\u000aWith about 90 minutes of bus time every day, I've also been going through books at a ridiculous rate. For just-for-fun books, I lean towards stories over non-fiction, and so that's been the majority of my recent reading. My current new favorite are Isabel Allende's books - fair warning, the Infinity Plan should have been over about 200 pages sooner, but the others have been excellent. Most are easily found in English too, so if you're looking for a new author, check them out!\u000aWater for Elephants gets this summer's "exceeds expectations" points. It was a random grab off the shelf (strike 1: the downside of having a lovely, gigantic library with oodles of books is that it also has oodles of mediocre and worse books), and general structure of "old person reflecting on some formative coming-of-age period of their youth" which is so terribly easily lent toward said mediocrity. And then it turned out to be solidly good, and fun to read as a bonus!\u000aAnd so that is how a slow summer in Boston goes. I hope your summers are similarly enjoyable and as productive as you would wish them!\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aThis is just getting ridiculous. Some of the snow piles around Olin are even taller than I am. But that's not the only thing that's ridiculous. In fact, that's not the only thing that's piling up either! As you may have read from previous posts, a lot of great stuff is coming. Classes will soon be entering full tilt mode as problem sets get harder to solve and projects begin, Candidates and their parents are nearly doubling Olin's population for three consecutive weekends, and so many events are happening just this weekend that I'm not sure what to do with myself. Yep, Candidate's Weekend 2, MakeMIT, a SWE (society for Women Engineers) Conference, and ICCAs (the International Competition for Collegiate A Cappella) are all popping up this Saturday. As a member of PowerChords, Olin's oldest a Cappella group, I need to be at ICCAs to perform. But that shouldn't detract from my point. There are so many things that Olin students do just because they want to, just because they think it will be fun. Someone, sometime, must have thought "you know what would be really cool? If I did this awesome thing, and got all my friends to help me out. And next year, we can do the same thing, and it will be even more awesome." This is the culture that Olin strives to create.\u000aEvery year since I've come to Olin, a bunch of students have gotten together and attempted to build an igloo. Usually, the entire Olin community ends up pitching in at some point, because building an igloo can be pretty fun, and the snow, like lots of other things at Olin, motivates students to have fun with their creativity. Every year, the igloo has gotten to about head height, and either we run out of snow, or because of the geometry of the igloo, nobody can figure out how to close off the top. This year, that finally changed. The igloo has been completed. It has even been slept in.\u000aThe first igloo to be completed since my arrival at Olin\u000aI don't know why I'm so fascinated that the igloo has been finished this year, I mean, we've been getting so much snow that you could probably make an igloo just by tunneling under the snow of the great lawn (which also has been done). To me, the chain of igloos that I have helped build represents both the excitement that Oliners tend to have for completing particularly daunting tasks, and the natural evolution that comes from spiral learning. Every time a problem is solved, there are always ways to make it better, to increase its potential, to think about it differently. With each snowfall, each time we have the resources to create a new form of an old prototype, we iterate and improve. All that being an engineer means is figuring out how to do this on the go, so that even while we are designing mechanisms or software or igloos, we can improve our ideas.\u000aOver the past few years here, I am not really sure how I have developed as an engineer from year to year. I know that I've taken more classes, but on the surface I don't feel much further than I have started. However, I've figured out a way to measure my experience, and that is just by comparing my thought process from year to year. Every year, as I learn new things, I learn how to incorporate them into my thinking toolbox, and as a result, I can think about old ideas differently. Being an engineer means being able to rethink problems that have supposedly already been solved.That's the exciting part, that's what gets me motivated. So lets get moving, lets iterate, and lets do something exciting!\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aAs a senior, I am (hopefully) almost done with my Olin education.  Perhaps some of our readers will be interested to see what my schedule has looked like over the past few years.\u000a\u000a\u000aMy major is Engineering with a concentration in Systems Design, which requires two mechanical engineering core courses and two electrical/computer engineering core courses as well as the Systems Design course and all the other general requirements.  (Olin's course catalog, which includes course/credit requirements by major, is available at http://www.olin.edu/academics/pdf/CourseCat2008-09_FINAL.pdf.)\u000a\u000a\u000aAll courses mentioned are 4 credits unless otherwise noted.  An "average" class load is 16 credits (4 classes); a 12 credit load is the minimum required to be considered a full-time student, and a 20 credit load is the maximum allowed (allegedly) without special permission (which many people get, though I can't understand how or why).  I personally took 16 credits each semester (in addition to numerous other activities), except spring semester of my junior year, in which I was in Rome and took only 14 credits.\u000a\u000a\u000aFall semester, freshman year (2005)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIntegrated Course Block (ICB; basically a blend of single-variable calculus, mechanics, programming, and modeling/simulation) (5 credits)\u000aEngineering of Compartment Systems (ECS; also known as "The Gill and Brian Show") (3 credits)\u000aDesign Nature\u000aCulture and Difference: an Anthropological Approach (Anthro)\u000a\u000aMy first semester was a rush.  I loved meeting new people--my class, but also all the upperclassmen.  I learned tons, spent a lot of time confused, and had many irregular late nights or early mornings as I learned to manage my time.\u000a\u000a\u000aICB included some math and physics lectures, problem sets, quizzes, and tons and tons of projects, posters about the projects, and technical presentations using the posters.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMatthew, Andrew, Eric, Gabe, and Clark holding Chester ('09) on a presentation day for ICB.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aECS was, from my perspective, mainly building circuits on breadboards and staring at the circuit quizzically when nothing worked.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWorking in the ECS lab.\u000a\u000a\u000aDesign Nature included an individual project--to build something that hopped out of some plastic, rubber, and other assorted components--and, as soon as that was done, a group project--to build something that climbed a wall (or at least dragged itself along the ground, as was the case with my team's "climber").\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMe with my hopper experimental prototype.  I was sad because it was too heavy (and could barely get off the ground).\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCulture and Difference included a lot of reading and discussions, and culminated in a small anthropological study related to physicists.\u000a\u000a\u000aSpring semester, freshman year (2006)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIntegrated Course Block II (ICB2; basically multi-variable calculus and electromagnetism) (5 credits)\u000aEngineering of Distributed Systems (EDS; "The Gill and Brian Show" part 2) (3 credits)\u000aIntroduction to Modern Biology (Bio)\u000aLinear Algebra (LinAlg) (2 credits)\u000aProbability & Statistics (ProbStat) (2 credits)\u000a\u000aI spent a lot of this semester reading in my Biology textbook (I have no natural affinity for Biology; it's always been a struggle for me) and wishing I had more time for sleeping.\u000a\u000a\u000aICB II brought lots more lectures, papers, and problem sets.  EDS involved more puzzling circuits, a coil gun, and a speech synthesizer built in MATLAB (mine said "save me," but we had a bit of trouble with the "s," so it was really more like "shave me").\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMy and Andrea's coil gun.  It was a monster.\u000a\u000a\u000aI honestly have little to no idea what went on during much of Modern Biology; there were lots of clear fluids and pipetting involved, as well as words (and acronyms) that I definitely did not understand.  In retrospect I'm pretty sure we gave some cells a new gene to make them glow in the dark, but I could be wrong.  Linear Algebra--an 8:00 am, two-hour lecture--was when I started drinking coffee.  (The story for its early starting time goes like so: the professor is a morning person, and likes teaching at 8:00 am.  In one of Olin's first few semesters, the students complained that they had difficulty concentrating so early in the morning.  The professor, in true Olin open-to-change form, changed the class to start at 10:00 pm.  However, he found the students to be just as sleepy in the evening as the morning, shrugged, and switched back to the 8:00 am time.)  I spent much of the time in class trying to keep my friend Carl awake, or at least facing in the correct direction while he slept.  (This was more challenging than you might think.  Many of Olin's classrooms have white/blackboards on all four walls...)  Probability and Statistics was not much different, except that I don't like flipping coins, and Carl had decided that one 8:00 am math class per semester was enough, and had dropped out.  I thus spent my coin-flipping time first guessing what I might have flipped, had I actually done it, and then working on EDS lab write-ups instead.  The professor actually found this quite humorous, and included a few exam questions about me and the accuracy of my coin-flipping guesses. And I finished my labs on time.\u000a\u000a\u000aFall semester, sophomore year (2006)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPrinciples of Engineering (POE)\u000aDynamics\u000aPartial Differential Equations (PDEs, or "peeds")\u000aMaterials Science (MatSci)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI spent a lot of this semester frustrated.  My POE project never worked.  Dynamics was a bit mind-bending with all the reference frames and accelerations and whatnot.  PDEs was practically a foreign language.  And the data that my MatSci project yielded almost always either defied physics (we assume due to machine calibration issues) or was completely meaningless (due to, for example, our sample slipping out of the machine's grips).\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aKate ('09) with the Instron Universal Tester.  Our silicon sample had slipped out of the grips--again.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSpring semester, sophomore year (2007)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aUser-Oriented Collaborative Design (UOCD; jokingly known as "Undergraduate Opportunities in Coloring and Drawing"--a nickname which does not please the professors overly much)\u000aMechanics of Solids and Structures (MechSolids)\u000aSoftware Design\u000aThe United States and the Muslim World\u000a\u000aI spent nearly all of this semester either working on Mechanics of Solids and Structures problem sets or in the design studio searching flickr.com for things like "happy" or "elegant" or "frustrated" in order to make visual representations of emotions and values and such.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMy UOCD team on the day of our final presentation: me, Dan, Leif, and Michael ('09).\u000aSoftware Design was fun, and I learned a lot, but it generally failed to demand much of my attention.  The US and the Muslim World required a lot of reading, which I think I mostly did, but I tended to zone off during lectures, and took to playing flash games as a result (this was a decidedly bad idea).\u000a\u000aSaki ('09) in The US and The Muslim World.  Chris ('08) writes on the board behind him.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFall semester, junior year (2007)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aComputer Architecture (CompArch; also known as "The Mark Chang Variety Hour")\u000aFundamentals of Machine Shop Operations (FuMSO)\u000aFoundations in Business and Entrepreneurship (FBE)\u000aComparative Politics (at Wellesley)\u000a\u000aI relatively enjoyed this semester.  CompArch was a good excuse to learn about how computers work, and also listen to Mark Chang talk about his favorite things--often related to computers, but also occasionally about lasers, food, sleeping, and so on.  My final project also worked stupendously well.  We created a cat-and-mouse game in Verilog to run on an FPGA.  There was no way to win--the cat always caught the mouse eventually--but it was fun and interesting nevertheless.  Machine Shop was somewhat useful (I made lots of random things out of metal), and also not terribly much work (except that one time when I had to file a piece of aluminum rod into a cube using only a hand file...  It was really more of a quasi-rectangular prism when I gave up, but the instructor didn't seem to mind).  FBE was mostly an assortment of not-especially-interesting lectures and presentations, and a project in which I was, again, not terribly interested.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMe posing for a photo for my FBE project: personalized calendars.\u000aMy Wellesley class was quite lovely (until winter when the roads iced over and my car slid into a snow bank, but that's another story)--I enjoyed having a class full of people I didn't already know.\u000a\u000a\u000aSpring semester, junior year (at John Cabot University, Rome, Italy) (2008)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIntensive Italian I (8 credits)\u000aDigital Photography (3 credits)\u000aPolitical Development in the Third World (3 credits)\u000a\u000aI spent much of this semester not studying.  I ate a lot, and traveled a lot.  There were many trains involved.  I did take lots of pictures and learn lots of Italian, and I did some reading for my political science class, but studying wasn't really the point of the "study away" (it should really be "'study' away") experience, so I didn't focus on it overly much.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMe with Michael, Russell, and Kevin ('09) by the river in Zurich, Switzerland.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFall semester, senior year (2008)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSenior Consulting Program for Engineering (SCOPE)\u000aSystems Design\u000aProduct Design and Development (at both Babson College and the Rhode Island School of Design) (PDD)\u000aEthnopolitical Conflict (at Babson)\u000a\u000aI'm really busy (as you might have noticed by my lack of posting).  My SCOPE project involves a team of myself and three others, one faculty advisor (Mark Chang), and one corporate sponsor (The MITRE Corporation).

We wrote a Phase I proposal and are currently refining and evaluating the feasibility of our design.  My PDD project is to re-design a carry-on suitcase.  I am one of a team of six--two students each from Olin, Babson, and the Rhode Island School of Design.  We spend a lot of time driving down to Providence and discussing the costs and benefits of shoulder straps and the like.

aV\u000aHey Olinsiders,\u000aSorry for the brief and disjointed update, but it's Spring Break and I am currently in Orlando seeking refuge from the endless winter back home. Hopefully Massachusetts will be a bit warmer by the time I get back, but for now, I'll be soaking up as much sun as I can while I'm here!\u000aThe Flower and Garden Festival at Epcot in Disney World\u000aThis break was much needed in more ways than one. Being an Olin student is fantastic, and I absolutely love it, don't get me wrong - but it's a lot of work too. Beyond escaping the cold, I was also quite ready to take a mental breather. \u000aI've also just realized how close I am to being halfway done with Olin, and it's pretty weird. It seems crazy that it could even be possible! It feels like I've just started, but also like I've been at Olin forever. I think that's an ideal place to be, though: feeling completely at home without losing the "magic" of first semester. Hopefully I'll be able to keep it alive until I graduate.\u000aCandidates' Weekends were great! If you were there, perhaps I gave you a tour or even got to interview you. I love that the whole Olin community gets to be so involved in the admissions process. It's really cool to see Candidates get just as excited about Olin as I got during my CW! All the Candidates I met this year were fantastic. Good luck to you all -I know you'll do well wherever you end up!\u000aHere's to a great Spring, wherever you are!\u000a-Haley '17\u000a

aV\u000aSo, it's the week before Thanksgiving, and things are starting to get a little insane.  Deadlines start crashing in, and the stress starts mounting up as we all start realizing how little time is left before the end of the semester.  Walking around campus, I can begin to see energy slowly starting to seep out of people, and others starting to get a second wind--though who knows how with as little sleep as some people seem to be running on!\u000aFor me, things are getting even crazier, as it gets closer and closer to conference time!\u000a        Trying to get a draft of a poster done, and all, or most, of the work done early that will be due during the conference is taking a lot out of me.  Not to mention that I just feel badly about leaving teams behind as we enter the final weeks to get all of our work done.\u000aFrom December 1-5, I'll be heading out to Washington, D.C. for the American Society for Cell Biology's conference.  Things definitely started to get real, when I got the program last week, and found my name in there, as an author, with my poster title!  And, thankfully, we got final approval from Dr. M's office, so the school will be funding our airfare and hotel for the stay.  Thanks!  Now we've just got to figure out which flight we want to be on, and exactly which hotel we want to stay in, so that the everything can get ordered!  And, I suppose that I should actually finish my poster too!  ;)  Basically, it looks like I'm really going to need the next week off to do work! Because I probably won't be posting before then, I hope you all have a great holiday!\u000aBest wishes,\u000aJessie\u000a

aV\u000aIt's been a semester or so since I wrote a blog post- but now I have handy iCals to remind me that blogs exist (thanks admissions!). Anyway, I am now a senior in college. It's only slightly terrifying- but whatever, I deal with it by doing super awesome projects. This year I'm on the Harley-Davidson SCOPE team (I can't tell you anything about the project, but, motorcycles!) I'm also working on a 2.5' tall humanoid robot named Jimmy that was dreamed up by a futurist at Intel.\u000a\u000aYou can see a news clip about it here:\u000ahttp://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50155552n\u000a\u000aThe out of context background video is actually this semester's Mechanical Design class- and the back of my head has now been on national television! MechDesign is a really awesome class- the theme changes every year or so, and this time, it's the first iteration of Jimmy. Basically, we split into groups and each group designs a joint. The NINJA (that's a course assistant, to the outside world) then gets to put everything together!\u000a\u000aThere's another design path we're taking for this humanoid robot as well- me and 2 other people are working on a separate version, based on the concept of passive dynamic walking. What that essentially means is that you can build a machine, put it on top of a ramp, and it will walk down unaided. If you design a humanoid robot to do that, then stick a motor in the hip and put it on flat ground, theoretically, it'll walk more or less like a human.\u000a\u000aWe're doing a lot of simulation work at the moment- basically, I spend lots of time yelling encouragement at my computer and hoping my display drivers don't crash again. (yay senior laptops!) We'll be working on this for the year, and then 2 of us will graduate- but the project will continue, and future generations of Oliners will make it even better (and half a foot taller, and several thousand dollars cheaper, and it'll be able to fly. I'm only exaggerating a bit.)\u000a\u000aAlso worth mentioning- the student-run Fall Startup Career Fair was last week! We had more than 30 companies, which was quite a turnout. In attendance were companies that former Olin students had started, and hardware and software startups of all kinds, including the awesome medical device startup I've been working for since May, Lantos Technology.\u000a\u000aIn the 4 years I've been here, the startup career fair has morphed from a small event with ~10 software companies, to an event as large as the general career fair (where companies like Microsoft, Google, and Facebook send the Olin alums back to campus to hang out, hand out swag, and talk to people.) It's been great to be involved in the organization of the event and to see it grow so much.\u000a

aV\u000aSince I'm not sure if I'll be able to blog again, I wanted to take this chance to write one last post. So here it goes!\u000aJust over a week ago was commencement (click to see some great 15 words).\u000aThat's right, dear readers. I, along with the rest of 2014, graduated. Crazy, right?\u000aI think the scariest part is that it hasn't sunk in. I still feel like I will be returning in the fall, surrounded by my best friends.\u000aI wanted to take this chance to list out some of the things I think Olin has helped me discover:\u000aBoston. Sure, we're a bit outside of the city, and many of us don't get in as often as we'd like, but the culture, sports, and people of Boston still make me smile (and I'm excited to return to them in August).\u000aSkillz. Since day 1, I've been using real engineering software, tools, and strategies to solve problems. And it's only beginning-Olin has largely helped me strengthen my love of learning.\u000aConfidence. Though I've got ways to go, I feel as though I can actually do things, in the engineering sense and beyond. Shout out to the amazing faculty, staff, and teammates that helped me feel this way.\u000aMemories. You can read back through my blog posts to see a few (click here), but they are just that: a few. \u000aTrue friends. I've already talked about this, I know. But I love my friends, and I am excited for the adventures we will have together outside of the bubble (friends, see that? I love you.).\u000aSo thanks, Olin. I think I can say that all of us have grown in some way or another. I'll truly miss you, and I am thankful for all that you are and will continue to be.\u000aTo 2015, 2016, and 2017- keep rocking on, and help Olin grow. To all future generations of Oliners, get excited for the best four years you can't even imagine.\u000a<3,\u000aJordyn\u000a

aV\u000aPeople say the last semester of high school is pretty chill. Sure, ok- but back then I still had to go to class every day. Now, in my last semester of college, I have class 2 days a week. SCOPE on Wednesdays; and an electronic music class at Wellesley on Thursdays. (My first Wellesley class!) The rest of the week, I have a gloriously empty schedule. Actually, I'll probably fill that with swimming and diving, rock climbing or ariel silks or something, research, work from my part time job, more research, exploring Boston (now that I finally have time) , building the LED hula hoop I've been wanting, and, like, preparing to be a real person.\u000aIn any case, this semester should be awesome. A quick summary of things I'm looking forward to:\u000aMy SCOPE team is going to Milwaukee next week, to visit the Harley Davidson headquarters - should be fun, 3 of us are from California and are perhaps a bit unprepared for this whole "Polar Vortex" thing.\u000aRedbones BBQ with the faculty! My hallway (all seniors) has plans to go out and get ribs and beer with at least a dozen of our professors.\u000aTurning 22! Oh god there will be so much Taylor Swift music. Why will that song not die.\u000aBuilding Jimmy the Robot!\u000a\u000aRender credit: Silas Hughes/Brooks Willis\u000a\u000aOr something like him. We designed this for our Mechanical Design class last semester, and my research team (which is working on a different aspect of the same project) gets to play with these versions. New toys!\u000a\u000aAnd, since it would be nice to have another picture in here, here's a picture of the laser-cut skirt I made last semester.\u000a\u000aThere wasn't a particular reason for this project, other than to see if we could do it. Jackie Rose (2013.5) designed the owl pattern and put it in to SolidWorks, I did the laser cutting on Olin's laser cutter. It took a little experimenting with speed and power settings (too much power, everything is on fire, not enough, it'll take you hours to cut through anything) Add a lining, elastic waistband, and half a day of poking myself with sewing pins, and I had (half) my New Year's outfit!\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBrandeis Behavioral Neuroscience Class\u000aOriginally uploaded by maia\u000a\u000aOne of the reasons I came to Olin was because the classes were small and not lecture-based. To be honest, I'd always considered myself (and Olin) to be better than big lecture halls.\u000aSo it's interesting that my favorite class this semester is a 110 person lecture at Brandeis.\u000aIt might just be the topic, since I'm fascinated by Behavioral Neuroscience and am prone to walking up to people and telling them "Your primary visual cortex is soooo cool!" It also might be the professor; Don Katz is amazing and I don't think he's given a lecture that hasn't given me chills. But I also really like the format.\u000aIn a lot of ways, a big lecture class forces me to be more independent. No one checks if I've done the reading. No one cares (or even notices!) if I don't go to lecture. And while it all ultimately ends up as a grade, for now it feels a teeny bit empowering.  I'm reading to learn and understand, not because of a homework score or the approval of my professor. It's something I do for me, and I own the responsibility for whether I succeed or fail.\u000aReading this over, it sounds like what every freshman at every state university learns. I think the difference (if there is one) is that I don't usually feel this same amount of self-motivation at Olin because I care so much about what people think of me. So many of the things I do are for other people. My fault, sure, but for 3 hours a week, it's nice to have no one care about me.\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aHi all,\u000aSomehow, while I wasn't paying attention, I've apparently run out of my four years at Olin College! My 66 classmates and I graduated almost a month ago now, on May 18th, during Olin's *first ever* sunny commencement ceremony! I think I can speak for not only a lot of my classmates, but a lot of college seniors in general in describing the weeks preceding graduation as among the most intense periods of my life. Things running across our minds included more typical finals-period pressures of wrapping up schoolwork, winding SCOPE up, turning in that infamous OSS final paper, etc. -- only this time exacerbated by the stresses associated with finding and negotiating jobs, graduate school offers, finding permanent housing and transportation where we're headed, etc etc. Phew!\u000aAll that said, those weeks definitely also qualify as the perhaps the one unit of time in which I have had the most fun in college. A group of us planned and executed a wonderful, Olin-ized version of Senior Week, which consisted of numerous receptions, a trip to an amusement park, a picnic, a night of bowling, more cheese, crackers and champagne than most of us will ever want to consume again.\u000aConnor Riley, also '08, cooks a lot of bacon at our class picnic, also blessed with lovely weather -- we really lucked out!\u000aPhoto courtesy Anthony Roldan, '08.\u000aSome of my classmates on the Ultimate Frisbee ride at Canobie Lake Park. We really lucked out on the weather this day too, and got to get on rides with virtually no lines, and even stay on multiple times if we asked nicely. Whee!\u000aPhoto courtesy Anthony Roldan, '08.\u000a\u000a\u000aInspired by our theme park trip, Olin's tight community, and the fact that this was probably one of the last times that something like this would be socially acceptable, one of senior suites threw a Kindergarten-themed party -- complete with gold-stars! Tiana, '08, approves!\u000aPhoto courtesy Anthony Roldan, '08.\u000aWe elected these two clowns to be our class' Alumni Reps. Well, they're certainly excited!\u000aAnthony and Tiana in another photo courtesy Anthony Roldan, '08.\u000a\u000aLooking back, my memories of the time are marked by a mish-mash of sheer excitement and nervousness about graduating and what the future holds for us, and the beginnings of the bittersweet realisations of "hey, this is my last week/5 days/ weekend brunch/ Thursday dinner/ time I am going to sit in the hallway talking to my roommates at 3AM/ etc. at Olin." I don't think it's really going to hit me 100% until September rolls around, and I am not driving back to Olin and worrying about getting my stuff out of storage (because it is all still in my parents garage -- *groan*). What is already beginning to set in though, is how much I already am, and am going to continue missing people in the future -- this includes all the great friends I have made in my classmates, as well as our amazingly friendly and approachable faculty and staff. Thank you, thank you, and THANK YOU all for a great four years, and helping me learn and grow so much as a person (I didn't notice that I had, but hey, ask my mommy :) ).\u000aAnd of course, for me, no post reflecting back on my time at Olin could ever be complete without specific mention of all the fantastic women I've met along the way. If you're thinking this sounds cliche, stop. Go visit a couple large engineering firms, some EE/CS heavy graduate programs and come back and talk to me. If you'd told me about this four years ago, I wouldn't have bought in to how much of a positive difference having strong female classmates around you can make -- but by god, it's been great. What I'm looking forward to even more is, for anyone that has seen episodes of the show Cashmere Mafia, having a group of really powerful friends 10, or hey, even 5 years out. Watch out, engineering world!\u000aHelen, Tiana, Nancy and Anne are just a few of the awesome women that graduated with me.\u000aPhoto courtesy Anne Itsuno, '08.\u000a\u000aAnd of course, the one last thing to wrap up a post about graduating from Olin: what the future holds for me. My plan as of February/ March was to enter a phd program right after Olin. However, the more I thought about it closer to graduation, I was beginning to have second thoughts about this, and applied to a couple full-time positions. I ended up getting accepted into the Leadership Development Program, which is a rotational engineering program with Rockwell Automation, who was actually my SCOPE sponsor! Our team's actually got 3 out of 5 members signed on to work for our sponsor full-time, which is apparently a new record for the SCOPE program!\u000aI was pretty excited by the breadth of experience and opportunities this program was going to offer me, and decided to just accept the offer and go with it for a while, in the hope that some work experience will better position me to be more certain about the exact direction I would like to pursue with future study. The decision to back out of a grad. school offer and fellowship to work with a great lab to do this though, was perhaps one of the hardest and grueling decisions of my life! I am, however, finally content with my decision, and really excited about starting the program in late August! Hopefully it will work out!But first, in other VERY EXCITING news, I am off to India for almost two months starting THIS FRIDAY!!! I am going to be traveling, visiting family, eating a lot, and just relaxing and enjoying being home after so long for almost two months until ~mid-August.That's it from me! Thanks for reading, and thanks for a great four years, Olin! :)- Meena\u000a

aV\u000aI don't think we've blogged about this before, based on my skim through the entries, so here goes!\u000aDespite how small Olin is, it seems everyone frequently runs into other students, alumni, parents, and other tangentially related people all over.  We've taken to calling this the "Olin Challenge" meaning you fail when you see someone.  I'm never surprised when I fail in the Boston area, but we've definitely had it happen outside of the country before, and generally all over.\u000aBeing in San Francisco, there aren't TOO many Oliners out here (the Olinglers at Google, and a few more) and my paths don't usually cross theirs.  It's a possibility for me to fail, but far less likely than it would be back on the East Coast.\u000aWhen I was driving to work on Friday, I [basically] failed the Olin challenge.  I found a car with an "Olin 06" license plate, and an Olin sticker.  Turns out that an Olin 06er that I haven't met works at Apple, and commutes the same way I do. I really like coincidences like this at Olin, because now if I really wanted to, I could email him and see if he wants to have lunch.  When I hang out with my Michigan friends, they get excited when someone is from U of M, but the clearly can't take the time to get to know EVERY UMich student.  It makes the Olin challenge a bit more fun than other happy coincidences.\u000aThe other fun part is when I wear Olin clothes and people ask me about the school, and are planning to apply and have questions. I like meeting prospective students- so here's an open invite! If you're in the Bay area and planning to apply to Olin and want to talk to a current student, feel free to leave a comment and we'll figure out a time.\u000a-- Ellen\u000a*UPDATE* I'm going to be meeting the Olin 06er for lunch sometime soon! Success!\u000a

aV\u000aRather recently finals week occurred, which is precisely the reason that this blog post is a bit late in being posted. Due to this fact, I felt that I must comment both on finals week itself and on the vacation that rapidly followed it.\u000aIf you are planning on coming to Olin, then you are probably already pretty darn good at tests and projects and the like. So, the one bit of advice that I would give to you is this: not everything must be absolutely perfect. Oftentimes at Olin, I see people spending their entire lives working to perfect one tiny aspect of a project and sacrificing many other things, such as social life, fun times and, of course, sleep. To be a nicely rounded human being, I feel that grades are not the only thing you must concentrate on. There are so, so many fun, interesting, and amazing opportunities and people at Olin that you shouldn't lock yourself away in your room the entire last month of the semester, working to finish perfect projects, because there are so many other things to do.\u000a\u000aOn the subject of Winter Break: for many people, this is the first time that they have been away from Olin for an extended period of time since the beginning of the semester. So I would like to remind everybody that there is a world outside of the Olin bubble--there are so many activities to do in any place that you visit during the vacation. Do fun things online--start learning a new language. Or an instrument. Or write something. Just generally take a break from engineering--or don't--but do something fun during the break. Enjoy your time off. And remember that Olin will be waiting for you when you return.\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aAh, second semester senior year.  What a special and delicate and despised time.\u000aI've managed to get most of my requirements out of the way, and so my schedule this semester only contains two required "classes"--my SCOPE project and my Olin Self Study, in which I'm learning nonlinear partial differential equations--and one "just for fun" class--Human Factors in Interface Design.  (12 credits--or three classes--is the minimum number to take and still be considered a full-time student.)\u000aNevertheless, this still means that I have to do work, which is kind of a problem, since all I really want to do is not do work.  (Looking for a job is more than enough to keep me occupied for the rest of the semester, anyway.)  I have recently found much more excitement, however, in helping my friend Lyndsey with her Olin Self-Study, which is in photography.  We dedicated last Friday to photography, in fact, which was an excellent decision: for her, because she's on track to complete her OSS and therefore graduate, and me, because, well, I love photography.\u000a        \u000aWe drove into Cambridge in the morning, parking at a famously cheap parking garage in Central Square ($1/hour--wonderful!).  We braved the cold and the wind, and walked down Mass Ave, across the Harvard Bridge, and started heading up the Esplanade.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLyndsey on the Harvard Bridge, taking a photo of Boston.\u000aWe made it perhaps a third of the way down the Esplanade by the Charles River before neither of us could take the freezing wind any longer, and we took a detour up to Newbury Street to get some tea (and a croissant--I can't resist a good croissant).  Our original plan had been to trek the entire length of the Esplanade, then head up to the Boston Public Garden and the Boston Common, and finally take the Freedom Trail to Quincy Market, stop by Haymarket briefly to take pictures of the produce, and then get lunch in the North End.  We decided over tea that skipping straight to the lunch bit wasn't going to hurt anything.\u000aAfter wandering up and down Hanover Street, we finally picked Ristorante Saraceno for our meal, and ordered two pasta dishes and a bottle of wine.  I spoke Italian to the owner, and we chatted for a bit (in English, mostly; my Italian skills have declined significantly since last year), and then he gave us free limoncello.  We were rather giggly.\u000aAfter a stop at Mike's Pastry (I needed a fix: cannoli, amaretto cookies, and sfogliatelle), we headed to Haymarket.  We photographed the produce, but it wasn't long before the cold (and one disgruntled salesman wanting money from us for photographing his goods) drove us back to the T, which we took all the way back to Central Square.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPeppers in Haymarket.  Not the ones owned by the disgruntled guy, though.\u000aAfter a brief stop in one of my preferred Indian groceries (I needed some paneer to make a curry dish), we were back in the car, heat and music blasting, headed back to Olin, happy and fulfilled after our much-needed break.  Also, Lyndsey and I are both still on track to graduate, which is always a plus.  :)\u000aGetting off campus is good and healthy!  Although it's a bit difficult to do if you don't have a car, there are shuttles that run regularly to Wellesley College (from which you can get a bus into Boston) and the Riverside T station (from which you can take the T into Boston).  If you're thinking about attending Olin, make sure to ask some current students for the most up-to-date information on how to get off campus.\u000aCheers!\u000aAngela\u000a

aV\u000aSo if any of you have been watching the news lately, you'll know Juno just hit the Northeast. Much snow was promised (and received) and First Years from warm climates (like me) rejoiced and shivered aplenty. I've skied before, so I'm not a stranger to snow, but the snow is usually on the ground already when I go skiing. Snow actually falling from the sky so much it blocks the bottom 1/4 of your window? Not a common sight.\u000aThe view from my room.\u000aAt least we don't have to shovel the snow away - we have great Facilities workers to be thankful to for that (I'm constantly seeing snow plows and blowers pass by my room clearing the walkways).\u000aThe door in West Hall that is closest to the dining hall - I thinkthis is immediatelyafterfacilities shoveled out that walkway...\u000aI've kept my blinds up all day to see the snow outside and watch other people do their shenanigans in the snow. The dining hall staff even stayed in hotel rooms at Babson College so that they could get here to cook for us.\u000aAnd yes, I know I mentioned shenanigans. Snow just seems to bring out the crazy (and awesome) in people. Because of all the snow (and the travel ban for Massachusetts), a snow day was declared (my first ever!). I walked out of breakfast (brunch?) this morning (afternoon?) and saw a lot of people gathered at the top of the stairs going from the great lawn to the O. Turns out, they turned the stairs (which you couldn't see under all the snow) into a sledding track. I've never sledded before, so I joined in and promptly got a faceful of snow. Sorry I don't have pictures of that for you guys - my phone stayed nice and dry indoors.\u000a\u000aSome other stuff I saw from my window - skiing/snowboarding. At the bottom of the second set of stairs going from the great lawn to the O, several of my fellow freshmen built a mini jump and brought out their skiing/snowboarding gear. Jumping ensued.\u000aDuring the day yesterday (before the blizzard hit), a lot of students came together to build a giant igloo. Snow blocks were made and put in place with "grout" (a mix of water and snow that brought the snow close to melting so that it would freeze blocks of snow together). Three people stood on top of the igloo and it is still intact, even after the blizzard, so I'd say it's pretty structurally sound (I wouldn't sleep in it though).\u000aVery zoomed in picture of the igloo as seen from my room\u000aOlin also has a tradition called "California Day," where on the first day that a substantial amount of snow is on the ground, people from warm climates (mostly people from California) don their bathing suits and run around outside. It happened at midnight last night (still before the worst of the blizzard hit I think) and many of us froze our feet. We sacrificed ourselves for the sake of tradition and being crazy hooligans (read: college students).\u000aUnrelated to the blizzard, Olin has a group called OWSAC, the Olin Winter Sports and Activities Club, which planned a trip to Gunstock, a ski resort close by in New Hampshire (2 hour drive from Olin). We skiied from 4pm to 10pm for the low low price of $32 (including rental!). The normal price is $42, but the Student Activities Committee sponsored the trip and reimbursed participants $10. I have skiied before, so I helped a couple of fellow Oliners learn how to ski (teaching people how to slow down was harder than I thought it would be). All in all, everyone had a great time (the people who haven't skiied before said they would absolutely ski again)!\u000aSo, to my fellow Californians (and people from warm climates), snow isn't horrible - it's fun and beautiful! Don't listen to the news when it's announcing the Northeast is about to implode due to snow.\u000a

aV\u000aSo while all you candidates have been getting excited and preparing for CW, many of us at Olin have been preparing for the FWOP musical, Into the Woods.\u000aThis is a huge show far beyond the scale of anything FWOP, our theatre club, has ever done.  We have a full-size pit orchestra and a giant cast that includes students from Olin, Wellesley, and Babson.  Rehearsals have gone on for months, and this past week has been utterly intense.  Sorenson (the Babson theatre where we perform) has come to be a second home.  Walking around Olin, you can hear people singing, humming, and whistling music from the show.  My roommate even learned how to play one of the tunes on the mandolin.  And nearly any word can trigger an actor to recite one of the show's lines.   I play Jack (of beanstalk fame), and many people refer to me as Jack, even outside of rehearsal.  Everything has become Into the Woods.  And in the mind of this theatre enthusiast, that's absolutely awesome.\u000a        \u000aAnd here's where you come in!  On Candidates' Weekend, FWOP will be going all-out.  On Friday night at 8 PM, you can come see Into the Woods!  Nothing else is planned for this block of time, and tickets are free for candidates!   It's definitely worth your time; the show will be great!  I haven't been this excited about a musical in years!  And if you still can't get enough of FWOP (who can?), drop by our table at Olin Unplugged on Saturday!  You can even here a few of us theatre people sing a song about Olin (based on an Avenue Q song).  Who could ask for anything more?\u000aAnyway, now that I'm done with the shameless plugs, I can't wait for all of you to get here!!  My CW was a blast; may yours be even better!\u000a-Dan\u000a

aVHello class of 2016! My name is Maddie (2015) and I can't wait to finally meet all of you! I've been working in admissions this summer and so I've seen all of your names and where you're from but I can't wait to finally put faces with the names!
p1269
aVOk so now on to what this blog post is really about... Hopefully some of you are having as much fun as I did shopping for stuff for your new dorm rooms. Even though I only live about 20 minutes away I still had to go through packing for college and I learned a lot about what to bring and what you can live without. Some people in my class know me for my amazing over packing abilities, so I'm here to pass on my wisdom to you about how to not over pack for school!
p1270
aVSeriously, guys, Maddie is notorious for having way too many things in her room! Take her advice and don't be that guy/girl. Love ya, Maddie! -Ari
p1271
aVWhat you really should bring for happiness' sake:
p1272
aVSome of these things are easier to buy when you get here. Frank's (the store at Olin) has some things, like hangers, and others you can pick up at Target or Bed Bath and Beyond, which are both up route 9 about 15 minutes away from Olin.
p1273
aV-
p1274
ag4
aVBedding (sheets, comforter, blanket, pillow) are good to have especially if you plan on sleeping, which I guarantee you will. Remember when buying sheets especially that our beds are extra long!
p1275
aVClothes: don't pack too many though! Remember we have a wardrobe that has 2 racks to hang things on and a set of 3 drawers.
p1276
aVTowel(s): I recommend bringing 2 big towels, 2 hand towels, and a few washcloths in case one is wet or for when you wash one.
p1277
aVMattress topper: One of the most important things in my opinion. The mattresses aren't super comfortable and so you'll want anything (whether it be a foam topper or a down mattress pad) to make your bed the most comfortable for naps and sleeping! I also got a body pillow and some smaller pillows for my room which was good for making my bed comfortable.
p1278
aVLaundry detergent: You're going to (learn to) do laundry. You're going to want laundry detergent. End of story.
p1279
aVLaundry bag/basket: It's nice to have something to put your dirty clothes in and especially nice to have something to carry your clothes to the washing machines in. I had a small laundry basket and a laundry bag and they both worked well. You'll figure out what works best for you but either should be fine.
p1280
aVMouse: You'll be cadding for Design Nature first semester and it's faster to have a mouse to do that. You'll thank me later.
p1281
aVExtra lighting: The lighting in West Hall is pretty terrible so it's very nice to have an extra stand up lamp or desk lamp or something to give your room a little extra light. All of the dorms have windows so you get some natural light during the day, but at night it can be nice to have something to brighten up your room.
p1282
aVBathmat: Warning! Thick bathmats will get stuck under your bathroom door so just get a thin one for outside the shower and then you can always get a thicker one for the tile in front of your sink.
p1283
aVNice clothes: You will have to get dressed up for career fairs and presentations so save yourself the call home to get clothes shipped over quickly and bring one or two nice outfits!
p1284
aVWhite board marker: All rooms have white boards outside. You probably want to be able to receive nice or funny messages on your board!
p1285
aVHangers: These are easy to buy once you're here in case you forget to pack them. There's a Target and Bed Bath and Beyond all fairly close by.
p1286
aVDecorations: Bring things like pictures and posters to make your room feel more like home!
p1287
aVWhat would be nice to bring but you can live without:
p1288
aVExtra seating: It's really convenient to have a fold-up chair or something for when you have friends hanging out in your room. The fold-up ones are nice because you can store them easily and then just take them out when you need them.
p1289
aVSomething fun (Frisbee, card game, etc.): We love taking study breaks here! And oftentimes we like to do something fun like play Frisbee or card games or something. So bring something that you find fun that you like to do with others (this is great for orientation and for the whole year).
p1290
aVOver the shower hanger: Try to coordinate with your roommate on this one. As you know you have your own shower in your room! The best thing that I, and many others before me, have found is that it's useful to have an over the shower caddy that hangs from the shower and stores shampoo and soap easily.
p1291
aVOver the door hooks: I really enjoyed having a few of these to put over my wardrobe so that I could easily hang up my jacket when I came in.
p1292
aVBig Mirror: There's a mirror over the sink, but sometimes it's nice to be able to see your whole outfit, especially when you have to dress up.
p1293
aVCleaning supplies: The college has cleaning supplies in the trash room, but many students prefer to bring their own bottles of cleaning supplies and paper towels.
p1294
aVStuff for your desk: You're probably going to want to write things, which means you're probably going to have pens and pencils, which means that you're probably going to want something to hold your pens and pencils in. Stuff to keep your desk nice and organized can save you time, especially as it nears the end of the semester.
p1295
aVCash: You don't need cash, but it's nice to have on the occasion that you order late night pizza or go out with friends. There's an ATM on Babson's campus that isn't too far of a walk and there are more in Wellesley and Needham. You don't need to have a large sum of cash with you, but it's very highly recommended to have at least some at all times.
p1296
aVMonitor: These are really nice for displaying things like CAD or movies, but many students don't have them or don't find that they need them.
p1297
aVSpeakers: If your laptops are similar to our laptops then they don't have the world's best speakers. Even small speakers that plug into your computer can be fun to have.
p1298
aVAlarm clock: First of all, it's always nice to know what time it is. Second of all, you don't want to miss class and cell phone alarm clocks sometimes aren't reliable. So, a small alarm clock is nice!
p1299
aVShower Curtain: The showers come with a curtain in them, but my roommate and I put another curtain on that had fish on it and was more fun. Definitely not necessary, but it just makes your bathroom feel more like your own.
p1300
aVCamera: Because who doesn't love bragging about how cool their college is on Facebook, and parents love getting pictures in their emails!
p1301
aVUmbrella/rain boots: Sometimes it rains here and even though we can run quickly between buildings, it's good to have these things in case you need them.
p1302
aVWhat you really should leave at home so you don't end up like me:
p1303
aV[if !supportLists]
p1304
aVWith that said, if you folks are from warmer climates and can't even handle a little nippy autumn weather, don't be afraid to bring a few heavier items! Notice Maddie said "ALL." There will also be shopping trips for those of you who have never felt the need for a winter jacket before. We won't let you freeze, I promise! -Ari
p1305
aVSo that's my room and guide to packing. Feel free to email me at madeline [dot] perry [at] students [dot] olin [dot] edu with questions or ask me on Facebook! Good luck with all of your packing and have as much fun as you can in your last week of summer vacation. Make sure to get lots of sleep (because you probably won't during orientation) and spend lots of time with your family. See you in a few weeks (make sure you introduce yourself to upperclassmen)! Get excited: we all are to have you.

aV\u000aTaking a breath long enough to leave this note:\u000aMy second vacation of the semester starts Friday. I have a lot I'd like to write about, but in the rush to organize the 2 weeks of travel and finish the first draft of the Organic Agriculture research paper for International Marketing, and telecommunicate myself both into a dorm living arrangement for next year and a summer job, I've had to stick with observation and put off on the synthesis. To add another significant planning task to the docket, Olin's online registration period will fall right in the middle of my wanderings; This is the sort of situation when one calls upon the good will of a fellow Oliner and lends them the keys to one's student account to click the buttons in their stead.\u000aI'm brewing up a story on a cool entrepreneurial experience I had recently: I got the chance to watch some masters students in business management deliver the final presentations of their year long entrepreneurial consulting projects. I'll tell you about in when I get back to Nantes at the end of the month.\u000aUntil then- bc\u000aCurious how I'm spending two weeks of break?  \u000a

aV\u000aSo I've been totally bogged down by midterms the last week and a half, most of which I spent miserably sick with a nasty cold.  I had three essays due for my Brandeis class today (comparative politics of North Africa), a paper due for non-linear dynamics and chaos, and a problem set due for transport phenomena.  Thankfully everything is done at this point and my midterm crunch has finally wound down.  Plus I'm also over my cold!  So I was feeling pretty cheerful today which has been super windy, sunny, and all around gorgeous for autumn in Massachusetts.  I did a little bit of kite flying, a little bit of work, and a little talking and thinking with Rod, the dean of student life, and Jeff.\u000aSounds like a great day right?  Well yes, and I can't complain, but there were still a few things making me pretty stressed.  You ask what exactly these things are? I guess it can all be summed up in the broad "what am I going to do with my life" question to varying degrees of the future. There are a couple issues here none of them absolutely immediate, but that's never stopped me from stressing before so I'll put the nearest to-term one first.\u000aI'm a NOAA Hollings Scholar.  While this is a good thing (my dad says that he never really liked Hollings all that much when he was in office but when Hollings' pet project offers his kid $16,000 he can't really complain) it also means that I have one more ball to juggle in terms of finding an internship for next summer.  Not a big deal except that none of the reminder e-mails come to my Olin address and instead are buried under hundreds of bulk bureaucratic e-mails in an e-mail account that doesn't have any options for filtering or forwarding (thanks a ton NOAA, I really appreciated that one) it can be hard to keep checking for the e-mails that never seem to come.  Well they came.  Apparently two weeks ago......and now I'm supposed to have my internship set up in two weeks.  Don't get me wrong, I've been working on this off and on for a while but I was expecting a late November or December deadline.  Two weeks? yikes!  It'll all work out I keep telling myself, and I'm sure it will, but in the meantime I'm still busy with everything else.\u000aThat brings us to issue number two which is closely tied with issue three.  So I bring you issue twothree.\u000aBefore I even came to Olin I knew I was interested in way more than just engineering, aren't we all.  However, I knew I wanted an undergraduate engineering degree.  The real issue comes up when I consider grad school.  I'm pretty darn sure I want an MBA.  So issue two right now is dealing with the leg work to prepare for that.  Like with the Hollings scholarship, I've recently had my deadlines moved up.  Harvard Business School just released a new program, called 2+2, aimed squarely at my demographic, college juniors in non-traditional majors like engineering, science and liberal arts (they were on campus recruiting last night) who want a couple years to explore and learn before starting their degree.....but the deadline is 7/1/2008, about 2-3 months earlier than I was planning on applying.  This also means that, though I can apply to HBS outside of it, if I commit to 2+2 I can't really consider other business schools because they won't be near notifying me before I have to make a decision.\u000aThis brings us to issue number three.  I have a significant interest in the Middle East.  Ideally, I'd like to eventually be working in some sort of technology- or engineering-focused   (and I mean this in a very broad sense) business in the Middle East after graduation.  At just about any other school, such as University of Maryland or Rice which I considered for exactly this reason, I would most likely be dual degreeing in international or Middle East studies.  By the time I graduate from Olin I will have completed enough credits in this subject for at least a minor at most other schools (Olin doesn't grant minors), but I really would like to learn more, to the point that I am seriously considering graduate work in the field.\u000aFrom this you might say "Why not find a program that does both business and Middle East studies?"  and I have.  In fact it's practically perfect.  It's called the Lauder Institute.  It's a 24 month dual degree program at UPenn where you receive a Wharton MBA just like any other student, but also pursue a masters in international studies at the same time.  The programs are highly integrated which I love.  It's a small class size.  You get intensive language instruction and graduate fluent in your focus language (Arabic for me).  So what's the problem?  I don't really like Wharton.  I'd much rather go to HBS, but HBS has no comparable program and I can't hear from Lauder before I would have to make a decision on 2+2, HBS's preferred program for college students to apply.\u000aSo the questions I'm trying to figure out right now are "What exactly do I want from an MBA program?"  "What do I want from my international studies or equivalent degree?" "Can I replicate the Lauder Institute curriculum at HBS even if I'm not in a formal program?"  "Are HBS and Wharton really all that different anyway?" "Why am I even interested in these things at all?" and, of course, "Can't I just deal with all of this later???"\u000aand I think the answer to that last one is definitely yes, for now anyway.  So I'm going to sign off here and go take a break.  The next entry will hopefully be something a little bit more humorous and upbeat, but if you slugged through all of this and have ideas for me feel free to drop a comment down.  I can use all the insight I can get ;)\u000a

aV\u000aAll right, I lied. There are in fact zero references to tambourines in this post. Nevertheless, I had to do something to get your attention so I could introduce myself as the tardiest of the new student bloggers! My name is Chris, and I am the second of the new freshman bloggers, joining our very own Colin. I will not even bother describing my many and varied interests, from computers to catapults to business and puppies (but I seldom exercise all the possible combinations of those).\u000aThus, I might as well jump right in to the overall point of this post: To tell you about an excursion I had two weekends ago in building trebuchets and launching pumpkins. One fine, breezy, and colorful fall day here in New England, I awoke to the rising sun through my window, and promptly checked my email for the first of many times that day. At the time, it was unbeknownst to me what I would encounter...\u000a\u000aI knew I had to do it. How could I possibly turn down the opportunity to throw pumpkins across ridiculous distances using absurdly over engineered devices that would likely deprive me of sleep for the better part of weekend just to build? It was an offer I could not refuse. Within days, a team was assembled, plans were drafted, and devious actions began to get underway. At the very least, we hoped our device would smash the pumpkins (or itself) in a spectacular way. When the fortuitous day finally came upon us, we were ready. We were prepared to offer our blood, toil, tears, and sweat to wage war upon the pumpkins by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the strength Olin's power tools could give us.\u000aHowever, that was only the beginning. We had no idea what to possibly expect. After the challenge formally started, we decided on our final trebuchet design around 3pm (other teams did an air canon and a slingshot), and then waited until 8pm to do a Home Depot run for supplies. Before I discuss the sheer scale of our trebuchet, let me show you the rough CADD sketch I put together:\u000a\u000aWe did modify our design somewhat from this sketch, which also does not include a sling, trough, or weight container, but that represents a 16' throwing arm, 12' long base, and 8' tall trebuchet. We designed our weight container afterwards to support up to 600 lbs of sand, optimized to a 100:1 ratio for throwing objects. We built through the night, and thanks to daylight savings time, got to bed at 4am with the majority of our parts built, but not constructed. It was quite a unique experience building a trebuchet in the middle of the Olin 'O' for several hours straight in the dark, with work-lights rigged on a 2x4. The next morning between 11am and 4pm we brought all of our parts down to some of Olin's Parcel B, and setup the siege engines in the middle of our autonomous vehicle-testing track. After bending a 1" steel pipe on our first weighted launch with only 150 lbs of counterweight, we proceeded to optimize our sling design and try to get the trebuchet to launch. It eventually succeeded, probably getting us between 50 and 100 feet, but with a crack developing down the center of the throwing arm once we added more weight, it was time to call it quits.\u000a\u000aOverall though, my experience two weeks ago was one of the most unique spans of ~30 hours that I have ever experienced. It brought me back to old memories of Junkyard Wars and classic Mythbusters. It was also an amazing team experience working with four other people to get such a tremendous project done. Moreover, it gave me great ideas for trebuchet mk.ii, expected to make its debut sometime potentially possibly in the vicinity of maybe the Candidate's Weekends next year.\u000aSincerely,\u000aChris\u000a

aV\u000aHey all!\u000aSince the last time I blogged, alongside getting senior year and SCOPE off to a rolling start, I've also gotten myself knee deep in fellowship and grad school applications -- and let's say a few of those things are more fun than the others.\u000aIt's times like this that I'm so glad to have SCOPE for a chance of pace senior year, to break up the monotony of classes and the stress of figuring out what to do with the rest of our lives in a couple months!\u000aSCOPE is, among other things, turning out to be a very valuable learning experience trying to coordinate a diverse team. For example, our team's working styles range from the very high-tech "can expect email response in under ten minutes" to the low-tech "organized exclusively on pen and paper." We realized very quickly that my favourite approaches to task management - digital task lists and project management software - would not work for our team. Since then we've implemented a more tangible solution - each person's tasks are represented by post-it notes in a designated section of our team room. This has been as effective as it is ridiculously simple for our team -- let's hope our good luck lasts!\u000aOur SCOPE team has also been spending a lot of time out in manufacturing plants trying to get some hands on experience with the manufacturing contexts in which our sensor will be placed. One of the first places we toured was the Boston Brewing Company's R&D facility, conveniently located in Jamaica Plain, MA.\u000aMy teammates, Hans, Helen and Eric on an interactive tour of the facility. Cool. We also got a chance to visit the Cape Cod Potato Chip Factory, again conveniently\u000a        located around Cape Cod, MA. While there, we got a chance to have some great conversations with their very friendly quality control staff, as well as hang out with their mascot, Russet.   Helen, a Cape Cod representative, Russet and I with some quality assured merchandiseApparently, Cape Cod Potato Chips also hosts a chiposaurus building contest for middle schoolersWe also got a chance to sample some traditional local fare That's it for now, thanks for reading!- Meena :)\u000a

aV\u000aHi everyone! Its great to be back at Olin, where spontaneity and scheduling live side by side in perfect harmony.\u000a\u000aA question that I get a lot when I give tours is "How do Oliners get off campus?" to which the honest answer is that although plenty of people do it, it does take a little bit of activation energy.\u000aGetting between Babson, Olin, and Wellesley (the BOW three colleges collaboration) is simple: theres a shuttle that runs between all three colleges every 30 minutes, so its easy to get from college to college for all cross registered classes, cross campus clubs, or cross campus events. Olin also has a lot of bikes designated as GO bikes, which are bikes kept in the East Hall bike storage room for community use. These bikes are handy for getting anywhere local (read: as long as you can pedal there and back, youre golden).\u000aFor more adventurous students (and really, what Oliner isnt?), getting out of the Needham/Wellesley area isnt difficult. If you own a car, you can bring it with you to campus and pay a grand total of $0 for having it on campus. If you dont own a car, you can easily send an email to our helpme mailing list and someone will usually give you a ride to where you need to go. Public transportation is also easy to access, and Eliot Station, an MBTA station on the Green Line, is (an almost exactly) 27 minute bike ride or 10 minute car ride away. The MBTA will take you directly into Boston, where you can explore one of Americas most historic and fun cities.\u000aWhat I think is one of Olins most valuable resources for getting off campus, however, is the college van. Affectionately called the Olin Van, our 7-seat Dodge Caravan is available to licensed students who get trained and pass a background check (for the colleges insurance policy). If youre going on a trip somewhere for a student organization or class, you can reserve the van. Maintenance and insurance is paid for by the college, so all you have to pay for is gas (and if you get funding for your trip, you might not have to pay for gas!).\u000a\u000aRecently, I used the Olin Van to go on a trip to New York City with 4 other Oliners to attend the World Maker Faire at the NY Hall of Science. Computing Conversations, a club on campus that hosts monthly code jams and weekly conversations about computer engineering and computer science, planned the event.\u000a\u000aWe had an absolute blast at the fair, spending hours walking around the booths and seeing what everyone made, individuals and companies alike. The 3D printing village was filled with tons of 3D printing inspired projects and even had companies showing off their newest 3D printers. Atmel casually handed us dev boards for one of their new chips and we met people from OpenDesk.cc, which is a website that hosts open source build projects (theres quite a few tables at Olin whose plans were downloaded from OpenDesk). We ended the day by watching a demonstration of the Life Size Mousetrap, a large Rube Goldberg contraption that ends with a giant weight crushing a car.\u000a\u000a\u000aAll in all, the trip was a blast! We saw so many cutting edge and inspirational projects, and were all itching to start more projects than we can possibly have time for.\u000a

aV\u000aMy alarm goes off at the unreasonable hour of 6:45am. I roll out of bed and turn it off. My roommate is still asleep as I get dressed: leggings, Nike shorts, tshirt. No, this won't do. Change into different Nike shorts, a different tshirt. Make sure to grab a jacket. Get my iPod and headphones. Fill up my water bottle. Too early for the dining hall, grab a Cliff bar. Time: 7:26am. Oops, I'm late... Someone calls me. I answer, "Hey, I'm on my way!" Less than a minute later, I'm across campus and jumping into the Olin van full of other sleepy first-years. Today is a big day for us. Today, we run a 5K.\u000aIt was my first 5K and I had planned on walking most of it. When the race started, I got so excited that I instantly changed my mind. Now I wanted to run! After a while I saw the first mile marker ahead and said to myself, "Yeah, I'll start walking when I get there." The volunteer holding the sign told me my time and I was like, "This isn't so bad. I think I'll keep going". And I did! I was just listening to some music, casually running. I hit the water station and stopped to walk because I know I'm not coordinated enough to drink water and run at the same time. I walked for a little bit more to take a breather. When I felt like I was ready to, I started running again. About half a mile or so from the finish line, I caught up with another Oliner, Phillip. I am so grateful to him because he gave me the morale boost I needed to finish that last bit strong. When I crossed the finish line, I smiled big for the photographer. A big sign told me my time: 34 minutes and 57 seconds. Pretty good for a first-timer.\u000aI was tired but so proud of myself. I found the other Oliners standing around and enjoying our reward of donuts and fruit. I never thought that I would have had the opportunity to run a 5K as part of my college experience. I had a fantastic time and can't wait to run another 5K sometime soon!\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aAnd, yes, I go to an engineering school.\u000aWhen applying to colleges almost four years ago, I made a choice- I was going to apply to technical programs. I also made another choice- if I could help it, there would be women around me. I knew that this could be difficult. Even in schools where the overall gender balance is roughly equal, this doesn't really apply on a major-by-major basis.\u000aTo be fair, I knew I also wanted men around. What I really wanted was to not have my gender be something that stuck out about me. I didn't want it to be a talking point. Note: Having gone to a couple of Magic: The Gathering prerelease tournaments in the past, I have actually had guys try to initiate a conversation with me with the line "So, you're a girl." This was precisely what I hoped to avoid.\u000aNote: I also realize my attendance at these events would classify me pretty highly as a nerd. We all have our faults.\u000a        \u000aI had a few solid options where the gender balance was reasonable enough. Olin was one of these. In fact, the next incoming freshman class is slightly tipped toward a female majority. I think this is pretty cool. (Also, looking forward to meeting you at Orientation, 2013!)\u000aThere are advantages and disadvantages to this, of course. Overall, it's a much more comfortable environment than I think I would have gotten at many other places. The other women here are overall pretty kickass, and I've developed a tight circle of friends over the past three years. It's also nice not to have to deal with the consistent disbelief of the existence of female engineers that seems to happen once we stray too far from our bubble.\u000aBut that is not to say that there aren't problems. The gender ratio is still very uneven depending on majors- ECE (electrical and computer engineering) is pretty dominated by males, while E:Bio (engineering with biology) is much more female-heavy (plus my E:Bio boyfriend). The faculty even fall along the same lines. ME (mechanical engineering) is more of a neutral group.\u000aI was originally an ECE major, before switching to E:Systems. As part of Systems, I still had to take a number of ECE classes. While 2010 is ECE-heavy, and has a lot of females, I found these classes to be especially frustrating. Many of the males had come in with prior knowledge, and were often had the type of personality that was unafraid to yell out answers, or mutter to each other about what the professor was saying. As a freshman in Software Design, I took this to mean that they were right. It took me another semester to realize that they were just loud.\u000aI had never had to deal with this before college. I had been valedictorian, and two of my very best friends- both girls- were #2 and #4. I had been with smart women, strong women. I knew I was awesome. But just before college, things started to change. People told me that I had only gotten into the colleges I got into because of my gender. (Apparently, this is a common thing for Olin ladies to have heard.) This was absurd. I had the highest GPA in my school's history- the second ever to get into MIT from it. I was invited into Honors programs at Columbia and others, awarded $40,000 in no-strings-attached research money from Tufts. In a year where colleges were giving out far fewer acceptances, I got no rejections. The fact that I was a girl did not get me into those schools, and did not get me that recognition. But those words, and the warning that I would soon be a small fish in a big (or at least smart) pond, made me terrified for college.\u000aAfter my right vs. loud realization, though, I slowly came out of my shell. I had not raised my hand nearly at all in Software Design, and ended up having questions go unanswered as fellow classmates strove to show off with long-winded questions designed to make the professor agree that they were clever. (Note: 30% of my class thought they were in the top 10% of preparedness for this class.) In Discrete Math, when most people were closer to the same page, I realized that the intimidation I had suffered through before was just a combination of my classmates being more confident in themselves, and more okay with being wrong. I started talking. I said stupid things sometimes, but I got through it. I still sometimes felt as though I was representing all of Womanhood when I said something stupid, but slowly I realized that probably no one else did.\u000aThis, at least, was in my head.\u000aI have had times, however, when male teammates have literally taken away the technical aspect of the project and given me scheduling and/or sewing to work on. This was not in my head. I started speaking up. I started working with male partners I saw as capable, and learned a lot from them, but still held my own (heyy Circuits!). What Olin allowed me to do, in having a small student body, and one that is generally respectful of your voice, was to find a lot more of my strength. To not let myself think of my gender as a talking point. There are always going to be some assholes who will still talk down about women, and there are always going to be those that don't play nice at first, but I'm learning how to get through this.\u000aAnd now, with this post getting to the point where it may be considered "too long", I'd like to invite my fellow female bloggers to talk about their experiences being a woman at Olin. And for all you ladies looking to go into engineering- do it. It can be hard, it can be frustrating, but it can be great.\u000aBest,\u000aJessi\u000aPS: Women's Open House is this Sunday!\u000a

aV\u000aThis post is part of a series. If you like, you can read the introduction.\u000aWellesley, the women's college just 2 miles from Olin, is the school most tightly tied to Olin: I think around 50 Olin students cross-register there every semester, Wellesley students frequent Olin parties, and we have a joint women's soccer team.\u000a I'm currently taking my fourth Wellesley course, Sociolinguistics, but my favorite interaction with Wellesley is hanging out on campus (usually doing homework). Here at my favorite places on Wellesley's campus:\u000aEl Table - often mistaken as a Spanish cafe, El Table is so named because it was originally located next to elevators. Those days are long gone though, and El Table is now known as a student-run co-op in the basement of Founders. Serving up cafe fare, good music, and engaging Wellesley students, El Table is my favorite spot to get an espresso before class.\u000aSCoop - SCoop is Wellesley's Sustainability Co-op, home to some of the coolest women on campus (they also throw a killer party). Check out their blog!\u000aThe Wang - The architecture award-winning Lulu Chow Wang Campus Center is Wellesley's newest building, and it's, in a word, awesome. Ever since Olin turned off the lounge fireplaces, I've gotten my fix sitting on comfy couches in front of the Wang Center's massive, roaring fireplace. There are few places better to be on a rainy day, especially since Wellesley's parking garage is connected, underground, to the Wang.\u000a\u000aScience Center Penthouse - The science center is a weird, ugly, building within a building that I (still!) constantly get lost in. If you can make it through the maze of entrances, hallways, and staircases to an elevator, I highly recommend hitting that P button and riding it to the top. The penthouse is an open space with tables and chairs that looks over to the ground floor of the science center. It gets huge amounts of direct sunlight in through the high windows, and the solitude mixed with all the bustling noises drifting up from below is a cool combination for studying.\u000aLake Waban - Any collection of awesome Wellesley places would be amiss without mention of the beautiful lake that is surrounded by runing/biking trails, pretty houses, and Wellesley's campus.\u000a

aV\u000a I love cheese. Gruyere. Cowgirl Creamery.Humbolt Fog. I think it's amazing. Which is why I headed up Cheese Club last year here at Olin (and maybe the year before? and maybe this year? running elections is not one of Cheese Club's strengths.) We made mac n cheese. We had cheese study breaks. We were at Club Fair and Candidates' Weekend and Family Weekend.\u000a\u000aBut I've decided. It's not enough.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe solution? Reyner ('13) and I are currently writing up a proposal to do a Passionate Pursuit. in cheese. A Passionate Pursuit is an activity, possibly funded, in which students propose a semester-long project, solicit faculty participation, and establish objectives. Students may be granted non-degree credit, and the Passionate Pursuit is listed on their transcript. (paraphrased from the student handbook).\u000a\u000aSpecifically, we are interested in learning about cheese from several different angles, including regional variations, history, types of milk, and tastings. We plan on culminating our project by making two different types of cheeses ourselves, and then presenting to the Olin community about what we learned. The very awesome, cheese-loving materials science professor Jon Stolk has agreed to be our advisor on this quest. It hasn't been approved, or even submitted, so I don't want to get everyone's hopes up just yet. If it is though, rest assured I'll detail our experiences here.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aYour head cheese,\u000aMaia\u000a

aV\u000a        In my old home, I ate in the kitchen, slept in my room, and studied in the den. Nowadays, I eat anywhere and sleep everywhere, but I can only ever study on a couch or at a desk anywhere else on campus. Back in Montreal, I could have gone from the end of dinner to class the next morning without opening my mouth (except to brush my teeth). In my new home, those hours may be the most exciting!\u000aI'll tell you a bit about it.\u000a\u000a        First, my room. It gets messy, it gets cleaned. I make the mess and\u000aI do the cleaning, because this is MY ROOM! At home, there were the\u000astandards of a higher authority. I choose the standards here. In my\u000aroom, it's okay if the floor is temporary storage. Sometimes, the desk\u000ais the storage, and the floor becomes a very (very) low desk. I'm\u000aflexible that way. Mostly, I return everything to its place. To me,\u000acleanliness is next to eating meals at regular times, which is above\u000ahanding in assignments on time, which is above sleeping at times. It's\u000ainteresting how priorities cascade. My room is my castle -\u000aliterally! We have no door, only a choice of over or under and\u000adeveloped techniques for both. I like to sit on the skateboard and pull\u000amyself under my the gate which is my bed frame, but my roommate does a\u000abackwards roll over the top (Korey is taller than I am). He and I agree\u000athat our room is a cool room. I actually have a third roommate.\u000aHis name is Corky, and he is a giraffe. I met him on a street corner\u000aone day. He was looking sad and feeling abandoned, so I took him home\u000aand cleaned him up. Now, he mostly hangs out in here, always there to\u000ahold my hat with a smile.\u000aI expect he thinks I should tell you\u000aabout the awesome study breaks they have here. He doesn't go because he\u000adoesn't study, but Corky probably thinks that they're swell and that\u000athey deserve a mention. \u000aI should start by saying that our R2s\u000aare wonderful, caring, imaginative, and benevolent. They know when the\u000adays get long and the uneasiness starts to accumulate. 'I didn't expect\u000athis part to take so long...' 'I just lost two hour's worth of work...'\u000a'I'm sick, I'm tired, I'm exasperated...' These sentiments, our R2s\u000aunderstand them. They know just how to alleviate our troubles, too.\u000aThis year, between presentation deadlines and part submissions, stress\u000alevels had begun to rise. Our R2s -- our champions -- they burst into\u000aour halls with bowls of baked goods and piles of pretzels. They united\u000afreshman and upperclassmen from all (both) dorms with promises of\u000apancakes. Boy, do they deliver! A fifteen minute to half hour break\u000anever killed a project, but going without these snippets of heaven\u000acould frazzle a mind. Carefully planned and tirelessly manned, these\u000abreaks could stand alone as successful events. In the context of\u000arelieving study fatigue, though, they are divine.\u000aThere's so\u000amuch more to be said about constant interaction with people. I can't\u000apick up my laundry without pausing to say hello to a friend or\u000aclassmate. It's distracting and it's hectic, but it has its upside.\u000aFriends for walks and talks are close at hand. The answer to a hurdle\u000ain your assignment may be next door. Somebody's cool project or\u000aadventure is immediately your business. If you're surrounded by\u000ainteresting people you like, there's no better way to live.     \u000a\u000a

aV\u000a        Partyin' partyin' YEAH!\u000aHaha, yeah we just trolled you!\u000aThis time around I figured I would team up with your other favorite student blogger, Jordyn! During the school year our minds are filled with circuits, CAD models, MATLAB code, problem sets [HIGH FIVE OXFORD COMMA], and the like, but in the summer we have so much free time that we don't really know what to do!\u000aDespite this, we have done a good job keeping ourselves occupied. Check out some of our adventures!\u000a        At the recommendation of Jessica in the admissions office, we went to Salisbury beach, along with Janaki '14 and Sarah '14. Jordyn and Janaki got homesick for the beaches in FL, and I got an an awkward sunburn patch in the one place on my arm that I missed with sunscreen. The water was FREEZING but we dealt with it - Sarah would occasionally check to make sure none of our lips were turning blue. There was a really cute boardwalk type village with very impressive sand sculptures and an old-school candy store! I got fudge and Jordyn got a deeelicious coconut truffle.\u000a\u000aFor the very last Harry Potter midnight event ever, we went ALL OUT. I wasn't even sure if I was going to dress up, but then Janaki mentioned that she had an extra Gryffindor scarf, so I decided to be Harry. Jordyn was a fanatical Quidditch onlooker, and we forced some spirit upon our friend Chase '14 by taping a piece of cardboard to his chest which read "Not my daughter [fill in the blank]! The Molly Weasley fan club".\u000aRight now, there's a rather gripping game of spades going on in a suite common room. We are also listening to Rebecca Black's new single (that's where the title came from). This is Rachel... She doesn't even go here. Ok, I'll stop with the meme references now.\u000a\u000a\u000aThree of our friends, Chase, Brendan, and Patrick (all 2014-ers), attempted to go backpacking in the White Mountains in New Hampshire, but somehow ended up at a beach... Leave it to engineers. As bad as they are at navigation, they seem to be just as bad at posing for pictures. Happily, they did get there eventually!\u000a\u000a\u000aMost importantly, we were in the greater Boston area for July 4th! Jordyn was extra excited about this, since we all learned how important Boston was in the good ol' 1700s [you may have heard about that incident with tea]. We headed to a nearby town on the 3rd, to Rachel's ('14) house. Here are some pictures of the local fireworks (taken by Brett - thanks, Brett!), which don't nearly compare to the ones in Boston, but were still fantastic!\u000a\u000a\u000aWe look forward to more weekend adventures!\u000aLater gators!<3 Casey and Jordyn\u000a

aV\u000aI think it's funny that as adults we deny the necessity of going home. It's nice to have someone take care of you every once in a while and to have people who look out for you no matter what.\u000aI think I needed a brief respite from Olin. I love the busy frenetic pace of this school, but sometime it's hard for me to be productive or creative without renewing my energy first(I've been saying I need a break for 2 weeks and it was lovely not to do work for 4 days).\u000a#butnotreally#hollabreak\u000aOver the break, all I did was take pictures, do some required shopping (for my passionate pursuit and for clothes), watch movies, and have a lot of undeniable fun. Of course there was guilt at the end of the week from not doing that much homework...but still. When I spoke to/texted my friends most of them were in the same boat. I guess Thanksgiving break will have to suffice for the rest of the semester-- Christmas break is just a few weeks way.\u000aI can't believe how fast this semester has passed. Between 30 hour/week Dynamics problem sets, Robotics labs, Linearity studios, Photography assignments, and the upcoming book, time has just flown. Time really is relative ;).\u000aAll the lack of sleep, the workload (especially Dynamics--the 4 credit class that should be 8 credits), and hanging out with friends from earlier in the semester is a blurry haze... because of howcontent I am at this moment in time. I know everything will be snap back into focus with sharp clarity soon, and that the next three weeks will be even more challenging and exciting than ever before. But right now is one of those perfect moment where everything is far away and close by at the same time.\u000a\u000a#whyhellobed\u000aIt's now time for me to go do all of the homework I've been avoiding so I don't start off the last 3 weeks behind...\u000aI know I really haven't spoken to you much this year, and I'm not sure if I'm qualified to give much advice, but here is some anyways: Go out live and live!

aV\u000a        As I mentioned a few weeks ago, I ran a brief life-hack experiment regarding treating college as a 9-5 job. I can't claim originality of the idea-I know I've heard it mentioned a couple of times before, but I don't remember where I first encountered it. \u000aAs you may have noticed, Oliners are a busy bunch. We take challenging-is-an-understatement classes with enthusiasm, pursue extracurricular interests passionately and usually can't resist getting involved in any good project. This semester alone I've been regularly involved in 4 classes, teaching engineering at a high school, a Spanish language co-curricular, the student Catholic association, writing this blog, job searching for the summer, a three-college culture and leadership group, and getting sucked (very willingly!) into late-night conversations about politics, philosophy, meta-Olin and "woah, how does that work!".\u000aI have two key observations to set the context for this experiment:\u000aThere are so many awesome things to do and learn in the world!\u000aI'm happier when I eat and sleep and have quiet-time regularly.\u000aIn order to maximize my ability to do both of those things, I've decided to just try a couple different time management/work theories and see what happens.\u000aThe 9-5 theory is pretty simple-treat classes as a clock-in/clock-out\u000ajob. No wasting time on the job; no putting things off until midnight;\u000abut at 5pm, you're done.\u000a        Here were my observations:1) Quantity of Time: 9-5, with no lunch, is a 40-hour work week. A normal semester load of 16 credits is theoretically a 48-hour week (1 credit = 3 hours/week, including class time, homework, projects and studying). 9-5 may simply not be realistic. However, I'm pretty sure I can't work 9am-7pm at 100% capacity-when I thought I was going to have longer days, I tended to hit a mental block somewhere around 3pm and either become very inefficient or take a break. I do not think I could have gotten all of my work done in 8 hours a day, and I usually realized this early in the day which made it hard to stay on track during that 3pm slump-because I knew I wasn't actually anywhere near finishing. Working through the evenings also meant I never got the chance to reset and be ready for the next day at "work". Some excerpts from my day to day notes on the experience:\u000aDon't think I can be done by 5; tired; fall apart and take a break...know class will go to 6:30...did not finish approx ; worried I'm falling behind in mp; stay up late working on applications-inefficient\u000a2) Not Like a Job: 8 hours of classwork isn't like working an 8 hour shift, and Olin isn't like a joba. Transitions: It surprised me how much more mental effort to focus on class work for 8 hours, than, say, working 8 hours in my research position last summer. At work, I usually had 3-4 major tasks/roles to switch between-with classes I have roughly that many per class, and just keeping them all straight in my head took some effort. Switching between them also was where I was most likely to get off track-requires more momentum to start a new thing than continue working on a task.\u000ab. Work/non-work: I tried to draw a sharp distinction between class/non-class and treat it as work/non-work. In retrospect, I probably should have anticipated this-Olin's educational theory includes a "Curriculum Continuum"-which includes formal classes, but also co-curriciular courses, research, service, passionate pursuits, clubs and recreation. Therefore, some of my "non-work" is actually quite a bit like work, and some class stuff is much less like work.\u000a3) Conclusions: Well, it's not going to be my long-term, this-fixed-everything! plan. That being said, I think there are some helpful bits I can draw out of this. One of them is around the "transitions" point above: what can I do to make those more efficient? Can I plan more ahead for the blocks of time I know I will have lots of tasks to switch between? Maybe a more logical division of time would be "long-tasks", "medium tasks" (a few in a row) and "short tasks" (several in a row). Hmmm...that might actually become the next Adventure.\u000aWhat about you? Have you ever tried 9-5 school work? Did it work out?\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aHowdy blogsters! I'm back from spring break - and just a little sunburned!\u000aToday was a getting-chores-done kind of day, so I'm writing this post from the laundry room in East Hall. If you think that sounds like a pretty mundane topic, you're right... except that this is laundry: Olin style.\u000aThe laundry tech-stravaganza starts with a quick visit to LaundryView, a website that lets me check the status of all the laundry rooms on campus. That's right, no wasted trips to the basement for me: I can find out exactly which washers and driers are free from the comfort of my desk chair.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMy dirty laundry, on the Internet\u000aSince there were plenty of machines free (it's nice to go to a small school), I head downstairs and load up my clothes. You do have to pay for laundry (tuition's still free though), but no quarters required. To start the machines, I just swipe my student ID card (which coincidentally also holds my meal plan, extra dining dollars, and gives me proximity access to all the buildings) and my account is debited.\u000aNext it's back upstairs to wait for the cycle to finish. I don't need to worry about checking my watch, though - LaundryView will instant message me when my clothes are done. In the meanwhile, I used up the last of my convenience dollars on the washers, so I go online and add funds from a credit card so I can pay for the driers later.\u000aYes, we live in pretty amazing times. It's great to have such a wired campus, but who knew laundry could be so high-tech?\u000aBONUS - Since I'm down here, check out some pictures of the facilities in the basement of East Hall (click for larger versions)\u000a\u000a  \u000a\u000a\u000aLaundry room\u000a\u000aExercise room (TV, treadmill, elliptical, rowing machine, stationary bike, exercise machine)\u000a\u000aMusic practice room\u000a\u000aBike room\u000a\u000aRinse cold, tumble dry?

aV\u000aI think you know that you've reached a certain level of recognition when a hug from you is listed as one of the items in the school-wide scavenger hunt. It was too bad, though, since I was playing. Not wanting the other teams to get those points resulted in at least one crash into a shelf.\u000aThe scavenger hunt itself was really excellent. Taking place from 7pm the 13th to 7pm the 14th, our teams wandered as far away as Cambridge to get items, take pictures, find information, and do tasks.\u000a\u000a\u000aThis picture related to the "play Twister in the strangest place possible" task. We decided Mass Ave would be a good place, since we were at MIT anyway. Some drivers weren't particularly pleased, but we were in and out in well less than the duration of the walk signal. It's always fun to tell people that you've played Twister in the middle of Mass Ave too. My favorite portion of going to MIT, though, was probably getting about 20-30 people to act out a biochemical process.\u000a\u000aAnother task was to eat a stick of butter between your team. We decided to bake cookies and work on some of the tasks that were more computer-oriented (eg Photoshopping your team into a work of art, watching the Charlie the Unicorn video without laughing, etc.). The cookies were delicious, and the half-batch that we made contained exactly one stick of butter.\u000a\u000aOne of the last tasks we did the first night was the "dress up a team member in as many t-shirts as possible" activity. This is Heena with about 50 shirts on. We got her up to 62, which didn't even come close to the highest, but we decided that it was better for Heena to not overheat.\u000aSo that was Olin's scavenger hunt! Some of you actually might have seen us wandering about if you were at MIT's CPW (I saw at least 3 students who were also Olin candidates). It was a pretty fun time, even if my team didn't end up winning. The winning teams did get handsomely rewarded, though, with $75 to a restaurant of their choice. Not bad, I'd say.\u000a

aV\u000aHey there!\u000aMy name is Haley Pelleter, Class of 2017, and I will be your blogger today.\u000aIt's nearing the end of October and fall, my favorite time of the year, is in full swing. My roommate (Olinsider blogger Anne LoVerso) and I have had our room decked out with Halloween decorations since the beginning of the month and plans of group costumes have been in the works for weeks, including Firefly and Doctor Who ensembles. The leaves have been turning all sorts of fantastic colors and the view from the fourth floor of the Academic Center is stunning. As a Massachusetts native, hearing people from other parts of the country talk about how the leaves don't change in their warmer climates is always entertaining. It also reminds me of how excited I am for the first snowfall this winter, as there has been much concern and even fear expressed among the Californians, Floridians, and Hawaiians in our midst. If you are one those people, I would like to take this moment to assure you, you will be fine.\u000a\u000aAs October and the first half of the semester are wrapping up, I've been thinking a lot about the incredible, whirlwind experience that has been my first two months of college. In this time, I have:\u000aLearned how to use MatLab and sworn vengeance against the world's scallops when the graphs for my first ModSim project refused to behave how they were supposed to (see Anne's post)\u000aBeen introduced to the almighty breadboard and the art (yes, art) of circuit building in ModCon\u000aBeen chided for my lack of "circuit hygiene," or ability to make my breadboard look neat and pretty (though this is steadily improving)\u000aLearned how to use SolidWorks and been amazed by all the awesome things you can do with it\u000aFinished and demonstrated a functional hopping toy for Design Nature\u000aWatched 13 science fiction films spanning a period of 60 years for my AHS class\u000aJoined OFAC and spun fire around my head in front of an audience during Family Weekend\u000aTraveled approximately 20 feet on a unicycle\u000aOf course, there are many things I'm forgetting, but this is a pretty good overview of what my time at Olin has been like so far. Even though there's always work to be done, doing that work can be a lot of fun. So while you may have noticed that we hold the #2 spot on the Princeton Review's list of colleges where "Students Study the Most," this is not to be equated with holing up in your room and crying over math problems every night. Here, that means spending much of your time working through problems with other people and tinkering with your breadboard or your hopper simply because you want to. And, of course, there's always extra time left to join clubs and pick up some new skills.\u000aAs I sit here contemplating my college experience thus far, sipping some hot chocolate and appreciating the fall scenery on this lovely Friday, I can't help but realize just how happy I am to be here. I think this, above all, speaks volumes about what a remarkable place Olin really is, and confirms that I made the right choice in coming here.\u000a\u000aI hope wherever you are, you're enjoying the season as well! (Even if your leaves aren't quite so colorful.)\u000a-Haley, c/o 2017\u000a

p1555
aVworried about the same thing when I was checking out Olin, but now I have come
p1556
aVto appreciate it. Our little Olin "bubble" may stop the outside world from
p1557
aVgetting in (I didn't know who was playing in the Super Bowl until I walked

p1560
aVI like to think that if I went to a bigger school, there
p1561
aVwould be about the same amount of people that I would deem worth talking to,
p1562
aVbecause it is very easy to find something to discuss with a fellow Oliner,
p1563
aVwhether it be the hover-text of the latest XKCD, or stories of the night before
p1564
aVthe design nature toy was due.
p1565
aVAnother thing I appreciate about Olin's small size is that
p1566
aVeach student makes a difference when they are here. In fact, the aim of an
p1567
aVassignment for a class called Foundations of Business and Entrepreneurship was
p1568
aV"change the world". For a lot of students, Olin is "the world", or at least a
p1569
aVstepping stone to the entire world. Many of my friends are in this class, and
p1570
aV\u000aone group
p1571
aVis working on changing the residential life world by making
p1572
aVgender-neutral housing an option for students at Olin. 
p1573
aVThis team has made an incredibly valiant effort to change
p1574
aVsomething that is controlled by the administration. Students cannot change housing
p1575
aVpolicy by just voting for a change, or by proposing it to CORe (Council of Olin
p1576
aVRepresentatives: our student government body). 
p1577
aVBut this FBE team has broadly spread awareness
p1578
aVof the initiative, given students a chance to express their opinions and
p1579
aVconcerns, and addressed most of these concerns in a way that satisfied
p1580
aVstudents. There have been anonymous polls, meetings, and open-table
p1581
aVdiscussions. And though there has been no administrative action to change this
p1582
aVpolicy yet, there seems to be a mindset change among students.
p1583
aVIt is a rather formidable goal to change something like
p1584
aVhousing policy, and the team is making progress. Olin is a rather progressive
p1585
aVschool, and breaking down gender-binary barriers seems like something that
p1586
aVcould be accomplished, perhaps with some time.
p1587
aVOf course, people have succeeded greatly in previous
p1588
aVprojects to change life at Olin. There is a room in the campus center that used
p1589
aVto have a pool table. Two students (before my time) decided that it would be a

aV\u000aWell, the year is starting up again. While most of my friends at other schools are complaining about going back to school, struggling through classes, and figuring out how to properly manage their time, I am excited. I don't know quite what this semester will bring yet, but I know for sure that all the things I am doing, no matter how late I stay up doing them, no matter what commitments I have to make, will be wonderful.\u000aJust coming back to school isn't the only reason why myself and others are excited. The expansion of the Olin community with our Class of 2017 is also cause for joy as students not only reunite with old friends in the first weeks of school but make new ones. While by now I have now probably met every single first-year (86 is a LOT) and high fived about half of them so far, I just hope I haven't scared any off with a creepily friendly attitude and a way-too-huge smile!\u000aAlways excited to meet new people!\u000aWith everything booting up, students are still trying to figure out how to balance their work and fun. Although they are basically the same thing at Olin, being able to separate your work from your play time is extremely important. However, because there are probably, in total, more clubs than students, and there are so many awesome classes to take, one can get lost on either end of the spectrum. Still, everything is interesting and amazing, so I can't help but sign up for everything that I find cool, and convince others to do it with me.\u000aAnyways, yes, I am doing a ton of different things this semester. But each project that I work on, each group that I meet with, and each class that I take will be another great experience. This year, I'm not just taking classes, doing problem sets, or building robots. No. I'm going on an adventure. And it is going to be...\u000aAbsolutely fantastic.\u000a\u000aGood luck!\u000a-Alex, c/o 2016\u000a

aV\u000aToday I am one step closer to Florence; today I received my Italian visa (complete with worst-picture-of-me-in-the-world). According to the inside scoop, the Italian visa office is one of the more difficult to deal with. I understood this after every single other person who had an appointment while I waited on Monday got rejected. Somehow, I didn't. I think I had the advantage in that I didn't have an anxious mother hovering by my side- I got the impression that that was decidedly an annoyance to the office workers. I came back today to pick it up, and suddenly things feel so much more official.\u000aCurrently, I'm waiting only on my course schedule and my apartment assignment. While in Italy I'll be living in a private apartment with 3-5 other students from the same art program as me, where we will cook delicious Italian food. At this point, I have about 6 weeks to go, and while that seems like a while, it also makes me realize how much more packing and moving and general preparation that needs to be done. Hopefully, with my departure being after the Olin school year begins, I can stop by and say my farewells. It's a little sad to be leaving my friends, but I'm going to have great adventures. Plus, I'll see at least one other Oliner during my travels, as we spend winter break wandering around various countries. (He's in Scotland for the semester)\u000aFor now, at least, I'm in a bit of a resting place. I just have to finish off work, go to CA for a week, then freak out for a week.

aV\u000aWhile I was home earlier this summer, I had to do some work on my car. Being old, it likes to break down from time to time, and being Italian, it likes to break down in the least straightforward ways possible. I have come to believe this is mostly because Italian engineers do the work of designing, but then go to the newrestaurantdown the street to celebrate rather than actually test anything (I mean that in the most endearing way possible). I'll spare you the technicalintricaciesof maintaining an old Italian car and simply say that it took three hours to remove the three bolts holding the coolant tank in place and another two hours tore-installeverything (re-installation was quicker after we decided to remove the firewall between the engine bay and the rear trunk).\u000a\u000aThe experience taught me a very important principle: DFx. It stands for Design For X, where X is some engineering principle. Maintainability, for example, or manufacturability. It's just a way to make sure that you've met allof the relevant guidelines, not just the ones that impact you, the designer. In the case of my car, the designers certainly did not consider an owner trying to maintain the car 25 years later with household tools.\u000a\u000aIronically enough I've been muttering a lot about DFx while working on my research this summer. As I explained earlier, I'm not building anything from scratch, but taking two pre-existing projects and putting them together. I decided to disassemble the flutter jig to make sure everything was nice and happy and wouldn't interfere with the experiments I'll be running soon.\u000a\u000aI wanted to remove the weights in the airfoil to weigh them and make sure they were correct. The weights are there to make sure the wing has the appropriate moment of inertia and they slot into some holes in the side of the wing. Which is great...except once in there, you can't remove them. There's no room for tools and shaking them...well, the thing is designed to shake quite a lot without trouble, so that was silly idea. Yes, I still tried.\u000a\u000aIn the end I had to break the wing open to get them out. Now, bearing DFx in mind, I wasn't simply going to make a new wing, put the weights in, and make any future researches suffer the same problem. So I drilled and tapped a hole in the side of each weight so that a bolt could be threaded into them, like a removable handle. *triumphant smile*\u000a\u000aAnyway, Olin has a rapid prototyping machine (a couple actually, I think), so it didn't take long to get a shiny new (red!) wing made. Here it is:\u000a\u000aWhat you can't see in that photo is that the new wing is the same length as the old one, but the cross section is about 10% smaller. Which is odd, seeing as I used the only appropriate file in the original CAD folder. Hmmm. This quickly became a problem for the entire jig. The team obviously made the CAD model as part of their planning stage, but made (numerous) changes as issues came up during use.\u000a\u000aWhich all leads me back to my car. I think Olin projects are like Italian cars. We come up with these plans and work tirelessly to make sure everything works for demonstration day. Sometimes everything goes according to plan, but more often than not, something comes up at the last minute. We get around it despite, over budget and out of time, but in those circumstances we're hardly concerned with whether or not someone will understand what we did a year or two down the road.\u000a\u000aIt's not a complaint - I've done that plenty of times already in my brief time here at Olin. It's merely an observation, one I'm sure that applies to schools (and companies) around the world. The moral of the story: rather than jumping in head first and just unscrewing things because that looks like the right thing to do, take the time to talk with the last person to work on the project and understand why certain things were done. You'd be surprised how many "hmm, that's weird, it didn't do that when we used it" comments you'll hear!\u000a

aV\u000aI hate to do it, but it's everyone's last day at work, and someone needs to admit that the end of summer is quickly approaching.\u000aBesides, I'm stoked about my classes this fall, so maybe I don't hate to get the ball rolling that much.\u000aI'm very excited to be designing my own major at Olin: Engineering: Cognitive Science.\u000a        My AHS concentration is in Linguistics, a humanities discipline that should complement my studies in cognitive science nicely. I've planned my courses this next semester to keep me trotting towards my degree. Due to some hurdles, (among them, having my request that Visual Cognition, the grad-school-level course offered by Brandeis's neuroscience department, be counted as science credit denied by Olin's notorious Course Transfer and Substitution Board) I don't currently have an approved course plan, so I'm blocked from registering for classes this fall. This is my disclaimer that I'm just planning on taking the following classes -- no guarantee!\u000aProduct Design & Development -- Angela & Bennett have written about this class, co-taught at the Rhode Island School of Design, Babson College, and Olin College. Like most Olin kids, I enjoy designing "usable" products and interfaces, and hope that this intense, team-work based class will give me lots of hands-on experience.\u000aArtificial Intelligence -- Roland & I are taking this class at Brandeis. While I'm more interested in the usability aspect of the human/computer intersection, I think that learning how to take a different slant on combining knowledge about how the brain works and computers work will be valuable. Plus, more programming experience never hurt anyone... too badly.\u000aPrinciples of Engineering -- Mechatronics class. Required.\u000aTangible User Interfaces -- Finally, this is the class I'm most anticipating. A Wellesley class, it's taught by the same professor who taught my Human-Computer Interaction class last semester. I was blown away that she got Honda to sponsor our class project (redesigning the interface and functionality of a car's "infotainment" system), and I can't wait to see what we'll be doing this fall. I would love to eventually be a user interface or interaction designer, so this class should be a fun taste :)\u000aThat's all for now -- unlike most of my friends, I'm still working for another week or so. I expect the next couple weeks to fly by in a blur of cross-country flights, unpacking, decorating, reconnecting, and all the other hectic parts of starting another school year.\u000a\u000aMaia\u000aPS: I cut off almost all my hair.

aV\u000a\u000aBonjour Olin community!Je m'appelle Steven. I'm a junior from Michigan, studying Electrical and Computer Engineering here at Olin.This semester (Spring 2011), I studied at Ecole Polytechnique, near Paris, France.\u000a\u000aThe image of Polytechnique to the French public are the uniformed students who march in the annual Bastille day parade, a 130 year tradition\u000a\u000a\u000aCarol Kelly, Olin's wonderful study away coordinator, asked me a while ago to cross post my blogon Olin's student blog. But by the time we figured everything out, my semester at Polytechnique was over (I ended 1 April)!\u000aSo in this blog post, I'll tell you a bit about how I ended up at Polytechnique, why I'm still in Europe a month after my study away semester ended, and show a blurb from a blog post I wrote two months ago, when I was still at Polytechnique.\u000a\u000a\u000aWhy study away?\u000aI knew I wanted to study away by fall of my sophomore year. I wanted to have a new experience and meet new people. Plus, I found Olin seniors generally enjoyed their last year at Olin more if they took a semester off or studied away. 4 years at Olin is awesome, but it's still good to take a break.And where exactly to study away? All I knew was that I wanted to go to a non-English speaking school in Europe, to have as diverse a experience as possible.Then one day I was playing soccer and saw Marc Sweetgall (Olin '10) wearing a "Ecole Polytechnique" t-shirt. I remembered my high school French teacher talked about how in France, one of the top schools was a quasi-military engineering school named Ecole Polytechnique. I asked Marc about it, decided to apply, and voila! One year later I went from being in the newest engineering school in the U.S. to one of the oldest engineering schools in the world (1794).Throughout my 3 months there, I've made great friends from around the world.In this picture: 2 Portuguese, 1 Lebanese, 1 Italian, 2 Morroccans, 1 Vietnamese, and 2 Americans enjoying acorda, a traditonal Portuguese dish\u000aI've also had great experiences: playing with a professional orchestra (they don't use letters to name their notes), going to a fancy ball (a 120-year old tradition at Polytechnique), eating lots of different cheeses and bread,  trying to learn quantum mechanics on my own, and of course.... traveling.Since last week, I've been on a month-long counterclockwise tour of Western Europe. I'm currently in Vienna with Jeffrey Atkinson '12.OK. Enough about traveling. You want to hear about an interesting cultural experience right? Here's something I wrote back in Feburary:\u000a\u000a\u000aThe world is flat... and trilingual\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe world is flat...\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd trilingual\u000a\u000a\u000aThe past 3 days, I've been hanging around Paris, doing the whole tourist thing (Louvre, Notre Dame,...) with some of my friends in PEI (Programme Echange International). I'm not going to talk about it, because it's nothing new. I'll talk about how international my experience in France has been.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aX has several "types of students": Students in the " Cycle Ingenerie": this is the equivalent to US undergrad. People in this program have to do a one year of military/service, and are the ones who get to march down the Champs Elyse on Bastille Day. Of these students (500 in each class)o 400 are native Frencho 100 are international studentso ~30 students are in PEI. This is the program I'm in.\u000a\u000a  Master's students: these are students who are only here for 1 or 2 years, depending on what education system they come from.\u000aMost of the people who live on campus are the students in the first group. Most of the native French students leave campus on the weekends to be with family in/around Paris. This weekend though, 500 of them rented a train to go ski in the alps. Yes, a train! With a disco wagon (according to my sources). So, I've spent a lot of time with the only other students on campus: people in PEI.Everyone speaks 3 languages, or more.\u000aAs I said earlier, everyone here speaks 3 languages or more (Native English-speaking peoples might be possible exception): their mother tongue, English, and French. Some of the PEI students I've met so far include people from:\u000a  Argentina, Cambodia, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan\u000a\u000aMasters students I've met come from more countries, including:\u000a  Chile, China, India, Lebanon\u000aAh, you say, where are the Americans? Read on and find out...\u000a "All my American friends speak Chinese"\u000aA couple of us stopped by the Htel de Ville (city hall) in Paris to watch some of the other PEI students ice skating. I ended up meeting a guy named Ilya (for those of you francophones, note the irony). I was about to say, "Ah, so you're the other American I've been hearing about!", when he came up to me and started saying: " Ilya". We then proceeded to have the whole conversation in Chinese. Ilya is actually Russian-American, but speaks Chinese + French. He's the only American I've met so far who goes to X in some form or fashion (for those who are curious, he's a New Yorker, from Columbia).\u000aMy friend Alexandre (the guy who cooked the sardines), joked with me: "All the Americans I know speak Chinese to each other, not English". Apparently the semester before, there was another Chinese-American, who only spoke Chinese with Ilya.\u000aDinner in English\u000aOn Saturday night, I walk into the kitchen to cook, to find everyone speaking English (all the PEIs usually speak French, unless they're trying to explain something complicated to me). I asked why. They told me there was a non-French speaker in our presence. So that's how I end up meeting Laura, American #2 for me, who was visiting her boyfriend, Tho, who studies here at X.\u000a\u000a\u000aAlexandre (Portuguese), me, Theo (French), and Pedro (Portuguese)\u000aMe: How did you two meet?\u000aTho: I was doing a research internship at MIT, in Boston\u000aLaura: And I lived in the same house in Boston.\u000a....\u000aMe: Ah! I come from Boston too!\u000aLaura + Theo: Actually, we saw your sweatshirt. We know a student from Olin, but you probably don't know him\u000aMe: I bet I do.\u000aLaura+ Theo: Matt Ritter* lived in the same house as us (Pika @ MIT).\u000aMe: of course I know Matt Ritter! I had dinner in Pika a month ago!\u000a\u000a*Matt Ritter is from the class of 2010/2011, depending on who you ask\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks to Carol Kelley for giving me the opportunity to share my experiences with all of you.\u000a\u000aI hope you enjoyed reading the post.

aV\u000aBeing constantly on the move for three months straight can be difficult, especially when you're in another country. This is just a list of hints to make things easier for you.\u000a\u000aImmerse yourself in the culture (read: food). Cuisine is often one of the most integral parts of a culture. Have tapas in a Spanish bar at 22:00. Order the roast duck in Prague or the steak frites in Belgium. Get a croissant in the morning from a French bakery. Sure, McDonalds are everywhere and they're usually cheaper than local food. But it would've been easier just to eat fast food back at home.\u000aSpeak the language...or a few words of it, at least. We've been to 10 different countries, and many times a country will have more than one language. It's impossible to always speak the local language, but David '12 and I try to memorize simple salutations, phrases, and numbers. (Hello, please, thank you, goodbye, and 1, 2, 3 are usually enough.) People really will be infinitely more helpful if you make an effort to communicate on their terms.\u000a\u000aThe US has a tendency to "Americanize" things. For instance, alfredo sauce isn't from Italy - it was made by an Italian guy who came to the States. So when you ask an Italian for alfredo pasta, they look at you strangely. :D\u000a\u000aBe an extrovert. Meeting people is the spice of traveling, and the best way to meet locals is to get out of the touristy areas. Knowing people can help - we knew someone who took us to a party in the catacombs under Paris!\u000a\u000aLook at things with an engineer's eye. I've gotten a really interesting look at engineering by traveling Europe. People here have come up with much different solutions to problems than we have in the States, and there are always more problems that need to be solved. Example: Water usage can be a problem, especially with toilets. Engineers here have simply introduced a "high flush" and "low flush" system, with a button for each above the toilet. It's much more efficient.\u000a\u000aAppreciate the history. I'm not one for history myself, but the fact is that the cities of Europe are much older than most places in America and each city has a significant history behind it. Being there can make it a lot more interesting - learning about the Berlin Wall was one thing in high school. When I saw it in person, though (or what was left of it), the crumbling wall really made me think about the hundreds of people who tried to escape over it.\u000a\u000aPack the right equipment. Ordinary things like a compass (useful for getting your bearings), paracord/duct tape (both useful for improvisation), and a foldable bowl might easily be forgotten, but they can make all the difference sometimes.\u000a\u000aDon't let your guard down. As much as it's good to meet people, there will always be those who are a little too friendly and want to empty your pockets for you. I keep my valuable documents and money in a money belt - not fashionable but very safe. There are also many popular scams around tourist attractions.\u000a\u000aLet go of your inhibitions. My goal was to leave Europe with no regrets, and I can safely say I succeeded. I'd say that's the most important part of any trip, wherever you go.\u000a\u000a< Derek >\u000a

aV\u000aSometimes, the stars are aligned just so (or maybe it's that they're not aligned) and it seems like just everything goes wrong at the same time.\u000aThis past week was, as you might have guessed, was such a time for me, and I'm just now coming up to take a breath. These boys (from left, Tim '09.5, Joe '09, and Michael '09, pictured at my house in Bellingham) totally saved me this week, keeping me sane with hugs, sweet messages, and trips to Starbucks\u000aThe Bad\u000aWell, this week has consisted of driving to Wellesley's library to get articles Olin's library doesn't have, crying during my presentation in Visual Cognition, Babson college closing (and Olin college freaking out!) because of an norovirus outbreak, UIUC students flying out for EoF2.0 conference and devouring $175 worth of cheesecake I picked up for them, near-constant sneezing from having a cold, 2 back to back design reviews for HCI and UOCD, and late nights in team rooms trying to finish my team's MatSci paper.\u000aOh yeah - and I totally sliced up my thumb just trying to get some olives for my nachos!!\u000aThe Good\u000aEnough with that - it's over with, and I'm done complaining (for now at least). Time to look ahead. I'm getting super excited for the upcoming week - it's shaping up to be a great one. Through some coincidence, both my little brother and my next-door neighbor growing up are coming to visit this week.  I'm stoked to show them my life here: Olin, my house, my car, my friends.\u000aWhen my Olin friends visited me at home in Bellingham this winter, it was an interesting (and slightly weird, to be frank) mixing of my different lives. I was a little nervous then, and I'm asking myself the same questions now: "Will they approve of my life here?", "Will their opinion of me change?", "What will my friends here think?". I'm bringing my hippie snowboard bum friends to Olin - a place that tries to be welcoming but as a result of its small size and close bonds between friends, often seems to quickly exclude outsiders with techy converstaion and inside jokes.\u000aWe'll see how it goes - it's not the end of the world if my Olin friends and my Bellingham friends don't fall in love with each other. They do inhabit completley different worlds. In any case, I'm going to enjoy showing my friends around Boston and neglecting my classes this week, and going to the Man Hall party tonight.\u000aKeep your fingers crossed for good weather!\u000a\u000aMaia\u000a

aV\u000aHey there, reader!\u000a\u000aLooks like I've done it again. I've gotten really good at these semester-ly posts...\u000a\u000aHere's a quick summary of this past semester in bullet points:\u000a\u000aClasses: Mechanics of Solids and Structures, Partial Differential Equations, Olin Self Study in Design + Marketing, Materials Science (Read: one of my most intense and fun semesters yet!)\u000aCool stop motion videos made about engineering and education: 1 [click here to watch]\u000aAmount of sticky notes used: too many to count\u000aNumber of big snow storms: 3 (shoveled my car for the first time-here's an image of what I had to dig through =[)\u000a\u000aMaximum concerts attended in a week: 2 (Imagine Dragons in Boston, Ingrid Michaelson in NYC!)\u000aGraduation ceremonies attended: 1 (Really going to miss you, 2013)\u000a\u000aToday marks 7 weeks until upper class students move in to the dorms (Thanks Brendan ('14) for the reminder)! Crazy, right? This summer is flying by-and I couldn't be more excited. Like last summer, I am in Wisconsin, working at GE Healthcare. Another Olin student, Chris ('14) is here as well, so it's nice to have a familiar face around.\u000a\u000aThis past weekend, I attended my first summer party in Illinois! Here's a picture of all of us. We sure represented Olin well, with 7 out of the 12 graduating classes present! I really do love how Olin parties bring together current students and Alums-it's great to exchange stories of what used to be-and what still is- a part of Olin culture! If you have the chance, and are a part of the Olin community, I highly recommend attending at least one.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNow on to the present...It seems the big question I get when meeting new people (or seeing people for the first time in a while) is "What will you be doing after graduation?" I don't know how many ways I can tell people I don't know yet, so I've started making up answers that might be right. We'll see what this year brings! To help on this journey, I've been working on creating a digitized portfolio of my work to send to companies. Like a good Olin student, I've color coded and used post-its to help me think about what's really important for me to share with others.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI may blog about this process (possibly due to procrastination) in the near future.\u000a\u000aI'm looking forward to what senior year will bring (and meeting all you 2017-ers!!

aV\u000aIt's always surprising, and sometimes slightly uncomfortable, to rediscover that feeling of having nothing, in particular, to do over a long break. I usually respond by making lists of things I've been wanting to do but haven't been able to. Right now that list includes quite a few books to read and a mandate to myself to write this post, among other things. What usually ends up occupying my time is sleep and spending time with friends and family.\u000aThe end of the semester is always busy. Here are a few things that took more of my time than others:\u000aHip hop dancing. Ten other students and I did a Passionate Pursuit in hip hop dance this semester. Passionate Pursuits can get up to 3 non-degree credit hours and a certain amount of funding from the school. Our Passionate Pursuit was 1 credit hour and involved an hour-long lesson each week from a hip hop instructor/student at Babson College, as well as additional practice on our own or in a group. We spent most of the time learning choreography to parts of three different hip hop songs of our choosing. At the end of the semester, we performed at an event called Night of Passion (specifically for Passionate Pursuits to show off what they had been working on). A lot of time near the end was devoted to practicing the choreography, coming up with outfit ideas for the performance, creating transitions between the songs, and helping each other with particular moves. None of us had specifically learned hip hop dancing before. The performance went well--we had fun, at least, and I think the audience was surprised to see it.\u000a        \u000aExams and final deliverables. Two of my classes--Probability & Statistics and Dynamics--had timed, in-class final exams. Studying for and worrying about these tests took much time and energy the last couple of weeks of class. Another one of my classes--Transport Phenomena--had the option of either a final exam or a final portfolio. I chose to do the portfolio, which consisted of pulling together all my graded assignments for that class and fixing mistakes, connecting them to the course measurable outcomes, and reflecting on what had been easy, difficult, and what I would have done differently.\u000aExpo. Short for Olin Exposition, a multiple-day event during which students make a poster or give a presentation on something they've worked on during the semester. [There are usually other parts to Expo, such as informal presentations and in the spring, SCOPE Expo, but I won't go into those now]. We also dress up for our presentations, which is always interesting at a usually overly-casually-dressed college. For this Expo, I chose to make a poster on the topic of one of my Nonlinear Dynamics & Chaos papers, which analyzed the nonlinear dynamics of a simple model of an artificial neural network. I had enjoyed making the connections between the subjects covered in class and neuralnets.\u000aI'm already looking forward to next semester, both as a chance to improve my study habits and because of the classes I'll be taking: User-Oriented Collaborative Design (UOCD), a requisite sophomore design class; Mechanics of Solids & Structures, a requisite MechE class; and Materials Science/Stuff of History, a really awesome integrated MatSci/History experience.\u000aUntil then,\u000aShannon\u000a

aV\u000aFirst things first: this is part of a much longer "brain-spew", the full contents of which can be found on my personal blog (brettrowley.blogspot.com). I didn't want to overwhelm you with information, so here is the bit I think is most useful. It's all in disconnected blurb, but the numbers don't correspond to importance. Sebastian kindly added some comments (in red) I found interesting, so I've included those. Here goes:\u000a\u000aLearn to be independent. Please don't get clingy. Don't shrivel up and mumble incoherently if your group of friends is not around. Please learn to become a person who can entertain themselves and function independent of other people. It'll make your social interactions a lot more enjoyable and will benefit your academic career, too. You've probably heard of "taking initiative". Do it! Be proactive. If something is not working out like you hoped or an opportunity isn't just dropping into your lap, don't take that as an excuse to give up. Send endless emails arguing for yourself (but don't actually argue - that just annoys people). Make yourself known.\u000aYes, go and meet people. They are amazing (it's generally a safe assumption that most people at Olin are amazing).\u000aYou need a BHAG. If you got into Olin, you probably have a good idea of what you want to do in life. But you need a clearer definition than that. You need a big hairy audacious goal. The point of a BHAG is that even if you don't achieve it, you will have done significantly more than if you just went with the flow. College is ultimately a business, selling you the resources and opportunities you need to do something. It's up to you to figure out what that something is and what resources and opportunities you need to consume to get there.Existential crises are okay though. Where do you want to go? What do you want to do later on? Having them is okay. Just don't have them every day. :)\u000a\u000aBut don't forget to enjoy the little things. It's often said that college is the best 4 years of your life. That can be true, but it can also be very very false. There's obviously a difference between being productive and having fun, but it's important to balance the two. Olin is nice in that a lot of your work is going to be fun. But it can consume you, too. Don't let your hobbies slip. Go to movies. Sleep in on weekends. Read books outside. Get to see places around Olin. Go on trips with friends.\u000a+1\u000aCollege will come in floods. There will be times whenever there is hardly any work to do, the weather is nice, and everything is perfect. You will be the most content person in the world. Then there will be times where everything is due on the same day, the weather is miserable, everyone is cranky, and there's nothing good to eat in the dining hall. You will be sick of things. That's why the little things are important (see #3).I think this was one of the lessons I learned.\u000a\u000aTreat it like an intellectual buffet. This seems like the best way to ensure you have a good time. Sign up for a whole bunch of things, more things than you could possibly manage together. Then just drop out of things as they become less interesting or too overwhelming. Don't avoid something because "you don't have time". You only have four years here - that time will fly by. I cannot stress this enough - do not skip an opportunity without a water-tight reason as to why you physically can't. As we say at Olin: work, sleep, fun. Choose two.\u000aWait, the first year is over already?\u000a\u000a -Brett & Sebastian\u000a\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aI spent most of this break traveling which is kind of ironic in a way because I'm going to be gone all semester.   I went skiing for a weekend, traveled to western Maryland with my family for a few days, went to Seattle to set up my internship for the summer (If you know how to find housing in the university district for the summer from abroad I'd love to talk to you) and then flew out to Arizona and drove back to the east coast with another Olin student.\u000aI'm excited for my summer internship in Seattle.  I'll be working at the Pacific Marine Environmental Lab at Sand Point.  My boss seems pretty cool and I'll be working on a unmanned aerial vehicle project.  I've also been told that the weather will be nicer in the summer than it was when I visited.  I think I saw sunlight for about two or three hours out of my entire three day trip.  The weather reminded me of winter at Olin, just a bit warmer.\u000aOverall winter break has been tons of fun and I got to see an bunch of places I'd never been to before.   I'd never spent much time  out west and I got to go twice.  I ate dinner in the French Quarter in New Orleans when I'd never been to Louisiana.  I visited five states over break that I had never been to before.  It was great.  However, it didn't leave much time in between jaunts to prep for leaving the country for 4.5 months.\u000a\u000a        I leave in about ten hours to go to Cairo where I'll be studying at the American University in Cairo until June.\u000aTraveling to Egypt required shots (five of them) and blood work that I didn't want to get done.  I also had to get my tourist visa (you apply for a student visa once you're in the country) and international student identity card and figure out banking since there are no American banks which have branches in Cairo.  I'm going to have to let my driver's license lapse while I'm gone since I can't renew until after I turn 21 and renewing it by mail is rather sketchy in Egypt.  In all likelihood the materials would arrive after I left.  Oh yeah, I had to pack too.\u000aPacking turned out to be harder than I expected simply because I'm not sure what to expect.  I've talked to about half a dozen people who have studied at the university in the last year and each has given me very different answers on what to wear, what to pack, and how to get around.  The same can be said of the travel guides available and the advice from the university.  However, they all agreed that it was a phenomenal experience so I decided not to sweat the details too much, erred on the side of caution, and made sure to pack a head scarf and manteau (the Persian word for a jacket that covers a woman's arms to the wrist and falls somewhere between mid-thigh and mid-calf, maybe I'll learn the Arabic word in the next few weeks).\u000aI'm now packed, which is why there are no pictures - my camera's buried in one of my bags, and I have only a few errands left to run today.  It still hasn't sunk in yet that I'm leaving.  Maybe it will at the airport.  It's funny because I'm getting calls, e-mails, and facebook messages from friends already who seem to have realized that I'm leaving before I have.  Thankfully I'll have internet at my apartment in Cairo so I'll be able to stay in touch.\u000a-Ana\u000a

aVLast fall I took a semester off from Olin and studied Classical Arabic and North African Migration in Rabat, Morocco. My semester abroad was the culmination of years of decisions and months of planning which all, ultimately, were essential to making it all happen. I faced a variety of hurdles in the winter of 2011, not the least of which was the Arab Spring; however, one hurdle which could very well have de-railed all of my study away plans was financial.

aVLike many other Olin students, funding my study away experience was something I had to do on my own.

aV\u000aWhile wandering around my home town over break, seems like the only question that got asked more than "where do you go again?" was "what is your major?".  As soon as that question came out of someone's mouth, I had three options:  lie, be as vague as possible, or get into a long winded conversation.  That's right, I've decided to be one of those difficult people who self designs her own concentration.  So, the real answer is that I have a currently pending proposal for a self-designed Engineering major with a concentration in Chemistry.  Basically, this consists of taking all of the chemistry classes Olin has offered, and combining those with Materials Science engineering courses and BioE courses that have relevance to chemistry (such as Transport in Biological Systems and Polymers--both of which I'm taking this semester).\u000aSo, for those of you who are thinking about attending Olin and have an interest in Chemistry, what does this mean?  Well, obviously it doesn't mean too much until it's been accepted.  (There have been BioChem major concentrations approved in the past, so that is promising.)   But, should the proposal be accepted, it makes it more likely that you will be able to design your own chemistry concentration.  That isn't to say that it will be easy--in fact, it probably won't be for years yet.  And, it is going to vary based on what classes are offered through the years.  In the end, the decision comes down to what you think is right for you- but I'm guessing you already know this.  And, who is to say that what you come into Olin thinking you are going to study and what you actually end up studying will be the same-- I know it wasn't for me.\u000aTake care,\u000aJessie\u000a

aV\u000a        Ah, spring break! A time to decompress, relax, breath deep, and preapre for the final haul of projects and work that looms over us all. For some of you, this also means the end of a long wait. One day to go, Candidates! You soon will be getting a decision in the mail that will change your course for better. "But wait, William, you charismatic blogger," you say, waving your hand. "Isn't the saying 'For better or for worse'?" And I would say you would be right. But that saying does not apply. No matter what decision comes next week, you should know that it is only a positive one, even if it may seem negative at first. And of course, the strangest things may surprise you in ways you never would have imagined. So, here comes my tale of how I found out my Olin Admission's Decision, also know asDecision Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Myself.\u000a\u000a\u000aI am bad at photoshop, so unedited this will have to do. And it's surprisingly accurate.\u000a\u000a        Our story begins a week and a year ago today, the day before Spring Break at my High School. I talked to my friend, a very good friend of mine, who's name is Josh. Josh is a swimmer, a navy guy, and a general all around guy, and the scrawny nerd me wasalways amazed that we, despite our differences, became such good friends through computer science. So, I talked with him after class and asked if he could stop by my house the next Friday. He, of course, asked why. Now, Olin's online portal was going down for maitnence the week they were releasing decisions for my year, so the UPS package would arrive well before I could check online. That wouldn't be a problem, however, I was going to be away on a famly vacation over spring break, and wouldn't be back until the decisions were posted online anyway. It was quite the pickle. But Josh said he was going to be around the area my house was anyway, so he'd stop by! I was estatic, and I thanked him so much for helping me out.\u000a\u000aFast forward a few days, and it is Thursday. Sitting with my family in our hotel room, I look whistfully over the vast pacific ocean and the distance between me and the UPS man who, no dobut, had either stopped by my house or passed it over. I had known that for Candidate's weekend the transitit time for the UPS guy was precicely one day, and it would arrive at my house around 7PM that night, which had long past by the hour that I was looking. I pushed it out of my mind as best I could though, and enjoyed a good meal later that night.\u000a\u000a\u000aSomething rather close to my view. It was nice.\u000a\u000aLater that night, my parents got a phone call from the alarm company. They had responded to a glass breaking alarm at my house around 11PM, and police were there and bumbling around. My first worry was that someone had broken in. My second, and much less rational worry, was that someone had stolen the letter off the doorstep (if it was there!). Again though, I pushed it out of my mind, and went on to tomorrow with high hopes that Josh would send me good word.\u000a\u000aThe next day, a few things happened in paralell. As we were preparing to pack to island hop over to Kauai, Someone who helps take care of the house stopped by on my Grandmother's request, and made sure everyting was in order. They also moved an envelope inside, but nobody knew about that at the time. She then went to tell my grandmother what she knew, including telling her about an envelope she moved, but that news would not reach me until later that day. Josh called around noontime, and was walking up to my house. There was excitement welling in my chest, heart was pounding, and I waited.... He said he saw nothing.\u000a\u000a\u000aYou lose. Good day sir.\u000a\u000aIn an instant, I felt crushed. Deflated. I was so excited to go to Olin. Candidate's weekend was one of my favorite moments of the year, perhaps of most of my high school days. It was just so exciting to be around such smart and interesting people, to do all this cool stuff, to meet all these wonderful students, and to live and breath Olin, just for a few days. And to have all of that come crashing down around you is painful, to say the least. I remember talking to my mom, who was consoling me, "If it were any other school, I would have been able to say that they didn't know me, that I was just a number and some test scores." And you do get that sense. In a way, if you really want to go to Olin, and you get rejected, it somehow hurts much much more then being rejected from any other school. It's the curse of what is, in my opinion, the best possible admissions process. Because it involves the trip out to the school, those who fall in love with it obviously feel a sense of attachment, and to have that stripped away can hurt.\u000a\u000aBut in that hurt came clarity. Because as I sat on the plane, I smiled a bit. While Olin would have been a wonderful place to go, I still had other options. And I know now that if I hadn't gotten in, if there was no letter, I would have been excited to attend any of the other schools that I had gotten into! I might have ended up attending a school where a good friend decided to attend in paralell with me, or perhaps found myself on the west coast, or somewhere completely different! And all of my experiences and challenges would be different and new and exciting! We make a big hoorah about the place that people go to spend four years of their life, but in the end, no matter where you go, you will make big waves, and you will be happy. It sounds kind of wishy washy, but I felt that way, everyone whom I talked to who didn't go to their first choice felt that way... It's the sign that despite all the crazyness of admissions and the math.random() that works into the whole process, people end up in places that are good fits for them. And that's important.\u000a\u000aNow, as you probably have guess, this story has a much different ending. Around 6PM that night, as we were about to sit down for dinner, my grandmother emailed my Father and told him that in fact, she knew that our housekeeper friend had moved an envelope inside. After debating with my mom for a few moments, he dropped the factoid on me, and I had to excuse myself to run outside and shout for a moment (just as a family was walking in... awkard!). And after the vacation was done, I arrived back after a long flight to see a UPS envelope, a letter, and a flash drive waiting for me. In a way, I'm glad it worked out how it did. Because it helped me to realize in the end, it's what you make of your four years, not what the four years make of you.\u000a

aV\u000aHey readers, I'm Mike. I'm a rising senior at Olin joining the blog for my final year.  Normally, I think the best way to get to know people is to swap stories over a good meal.  So I'll spend my first post talking about food.\u000aMEALS ABROAD\u000aThis past semester I studied in Aberdeen, Scotland and traveled throughout western Europe.  Here are some culinary highlights.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHere's me enjoying delicious pizza on my first night in Rome.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe best cheesecake on the planet is Bailey's Irish Cream Cheesecake, served in Dublin.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Eiffel Tower is an unbelievable picnic spot.  Especially after dark as the city starts to glow.\u000a\u000aEATING AT OLIN\u000a\u000a\u000aI'm pretty sure my favorite place at Olin is the fantastic all-you-can-eat campus dining hall.  During the semester, I eat all my meals here, and would probably have at least one more per day if they didn't close after dinner.  The Chicken Parm sandwich is ridiculously tasty, the curly fries are top-notch, and the fajitas, while admittedly not the least bit authentic, are nevertheless always able to fill me up on Wednesday afternoons.  Some weekends the made-to-order omelets are the only things that pull me out of bed before 2PM (yes, we have a very forgiving brunch schedule).\u000a\u000a\u000aHOW I LEARNED TO COOK\u000aWhile I've never really been hungry at Olin (except when the dining hall is closed), the experience as definitely failed to teach me important life skills like planning and preparing meals for myself.  I've known my way around Cup o' Noodles and Hot Pockets for a while now, but I think that hardly qualifies as lasting nourishment.  So I got a rude awakening this past semester when I arrived for my study abroad experience in Scotland only to find out that the school I chose offered absolutely no meal plan.\u000a\u000a\u000aLuckily for me, I had plenty of time and a girlfriend who knew her way around a kitchen but refused to let me just stand by and watch.  Together, we honed crucial culinary skills like budget grocery shopping without a car, troubleshooting lack-of-ingredient dilemmas, and maximizing the value of leftovers.  We not only survived the semester extremely well-fed, but could look forward to a new (and tasty) challenge almost every evening.  I learned two big lessons:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1) Cooking (like most things) is pretty much always more fun when you plan and execute it with someone else.\u000a2)  Never, ever lose a bet that forces you to do dish duty every night for a week. (Long story... ).\u000a\u000aMore importantly, I got to make and eat awesome food like Peanut Noodle Stir-fry, Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli (from scratch...even the noodles!) and Cheesy Black Bean Enchiladas (below).\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks for reading, and eat well this summer.\u000aMike\u000a\u000a\u000aPS:  If you get hungry someday soon, try out this stellar recipe for Spinach Lasagna, given to me by my old roommate Alex Jones '11.  It was basically the first recipe I ever perfected, and still one of my all-time favorites.\u000a

aV\u000aSo when I signed up for the overnight Indoor Ultimate Frisbee Tournament nearby in Worcester, I expected to have a fun night filled with Ultimate and a great opportunity to meet new people in the Ultimate community. The tournament, called The Buck Starts Here, was a charity tournament that benefitted Ultimate Peace, a charity that utilizes Ultimate to build bridges with youth around the world. When the disc mailing list sent out an email about the tournament, I could not pass up the opportunity to put a long night into Ultimate.\u000aI did my best to convince people to join me at the tournament, and by the time it rolled around, I was going with Kristyn, a fellow first-year, Maggie and Janie, two juniors, captains of the Flying Franks, and AJ, the Ultimate Coach himself. It was an hour ride to the indoor fields and we were all excited to get going. The tournament started at 11pm and ended at 7am, and we were all half dreading and half anticipating the long night ahead of us. We arrived and got randomly assigned to teams. Me and Kristyn ended up together and AJ, Maggie, and Janie also ended up on the same team. They had a bi for the first game, and so they sat by and watched me and Kristyn play.\u000aOur team was pretty great, with jabs and laughs happening even as we were just going around introducing ourselves. The game began, and I was trying to adjust to playing indoors. If you have never seen an indoor field, basically, it is a hockey rink with turf instead of ice. The field is primarily used for soccer, so there are lines in the turf marking half field and a goalie box, etc. There was also a goal built into each side of the field. I had an alright first half of the game, making a few mistakes on offense, but making up for them on defense with a layout D and a hand block. I continued to push myself, and as a disc went into the air while I was on defense, I came over the top of my player trying to get the D before he was able to get to the disc. I just barely miss the disc, and as I turn to slow down a wall meets me, right in the head.\u000aI was able to get my hands up, but they absorb very little of the impact. I immediately raise my hands above my head and start walking off of the field. Maggie and Janie come out to help walk me off, because I am obviously shaken up by the hit. AJ ends up missing his first few games to take me to the hospital to ensure I don't have a concussion, and luckily I don't. I was actually able to return to the tournament and make the last game for our team. We made it to the semifinals, only losing that first game.\u000a\u000aIt doesn't hurt, I promise.\u000aHowever, due to the swelling that has been occuring on my forehead, all the blood vessels in the sensitive tissue around my right eye have ruptured, leaving me with a gnarly shiner. Keep an eye out for me at your Candidate's Weekend. Come say hi, and you won't even have to ask where I got the black eye!\u000aAnd to make this post not entirely unrelated to Olin, I'll ramble a bit about how my semester has been. I decided to take 20 credits this semester, both to challenge myself with a heavy workload and because there were a lot of different courses I was interested in taking. I am taking Linearity I, Real World Measurements, Software Design, Modsim Mechanics, and Mechanical Prototyping. Modsim mechanics and Mechanical prototyping are going to become the two biggest time sinks as I progress in the semester but right now Linearity is holding its own as well.\u000aI have been super busy, staying up till two or three every night. This last weekend was really the first time that I was really able to spend a whole day without doing any work and not feel like I just doomed myself for the next week. Even though I have the heavy workload, the fact that I am really into Mech Proto and SoftDes has made things fairly manageable. Our most recent project for Mech Proto was designing a box that incorporated several different wood joints and fasteners. It was a fun little project and turned up some really awesome designs in our class. My and Lindsey decided to do a puzzle box and had a ton of fun Cadding it, and then seeing it actually exist in less than a week after some organized assembly. I think even though that class will definitely own quite a few of my nights this semester, it will easily be my favorite.\u000aWhat a beauty!\u000aAgain, I hope you had/will have a great time at your CW if your are a Candidate, and have a good life in general to all readers. I put a lot of work into the Design Challenge, so I hope that that event in particular was/will be an awesome time for you! See you later!\u000a

aVIm a vegetarian; I have been all my life. My great-grandmother became vegetarian in Holland in WWII, and she never went back, passing the diet down to her kids, who passed it to theirs, who passed it to me. The whole process means my sister and I are four generations removed from meat.
p1658
aVAustin is a vegetarian friendly community, maybe 1 in 20 of the kids in my high school were vegetarian. But it doesnt have anything on Olin. By my count, my class has 9 vegetarians and 2 vegans, which is more like 1 in 8. The Olin dining hall does a pretty good job accommodating this, all things considered, but sometimes youre just out of luck. And when nothing is good in the dining hall, there is one option you can always turn to: the soup.
p1659
aVThe Olin College soup alcove.
p1660
aVSeriously, 
p1661
aValways
p1662
aV. The rest of the dining hall fare ranges from tasty! to what? but the vegetarian soup option is ever present and consistently good, and when youre adjusting to a completely new school, something consistent in your routine makes all the difference.
p1663
aVSo I made it my mission to try all the soup in the dining hall. I bet they have some sort of weekly rotation, I thought to myself, Ill just try all the different varieties, and then Ill know on which days to have soup. And so my epic Soup Quest was born. Surprisingly though, it 
p1664
aVstill isnt finished
p1665
aV. Ive had soup every day for over two weeks with no repeats I can remember. (Id say so far that the mushroom and barley is the best, but potato with dill is a close second). Ive learned a lot about soup in these past two weeks, but heres a story about one more thing Soup Quest taught me.
p1666
aVYesterday, I came out of a Design Nature lecture to discover that the dining hall staff had taken the days soup out of its alcove and put it in the main line for the first time. Unsurprisingly, a far larger portion of my dining hall companions had bowls that day, and it coincided nicely with the lesson we had just left. The punchline was that as engineers, we should be wary of certain rules in our society, and be ready to break them. They werent rules like how much budget we had or how safe we had to be in the shop, but implied social rules like a hopper jumps upward, not sideways or your design should have legs, not wheels. The implied rule of the dining hall was the order people went through the line in: entre, grill, salad, drinks, table. Soup rarely factored in, simply because it was in an alcove outside of the main serving area.
p1667
aVDont be afraid to break rules at Olin  whether theyre engineering or social. Your experience will be all the more delicious for it!

aV\u000aIt's been one week since second semester got going. A week! Sure seems a lot longer than that...\u000a\u000aAs some of you might know, my last semester was fairly rough. Grades turned out alright, but I promised myself that I wouldn't make the same mistakes again. I thought I had done a good job of applying those lessons to this semester, but I guess as an Oliner, I can't help but be as busy as is humanly possible.\u000aThe unfortunate thing is that it's all stuff I'm really excited about. Genuinely interested in, not just "oh, that would be a good resume item" level of interest. There are the classes:\u000a\u000a\u000aGerman 102: it comes after German 101! New teacher, only Olin student, harder material - it's going really well so far though.\u000a\u000aStuff of History (Stuff): a history and materials science course taught together. Get to talk about Mesopotamia and cordless phones. Taught by the incredible Rob Martello and Jon Stolk. Don't think of this as two separate courses, just one giant one.\u000a\u000aUser Orientated Collaborative Design (UOCD): one of the required courses at Olin, UOCD gives everyone an introduction to Engineering Design. If you're a Design major (like me!) this class is going to be very exciting. Oh, and busy. Did I mention that already?\u000aBut you can't forgetextracurriculars! You never can at Olin, but definitely not for me this semester:\u000a\u000a\u000aDesigning Impactful Communication for Education Innovation at Olin (DICEIO): a student project under the supervision of Mark Somerville, Lynn Stein, and Tony Wagner (Olin, Olin, Harvard,respectively) looking into how we can better tell the Olin story. You might know that Olin is doing lots of cool things, but there seems to be a need to come and see it for yourself before you "get it". We're hoping to change that.\u000a\u000aDesign Realization Lab (DRL): continuing the work I'm doing with Lawrence Neeley from last semester, although probably with a slightly clearer focus than before.\u000aAnd I'm still part of the Foundry board and I'm still working for Communications doing all sorts of graphic design (although the more I do, it seems the more other people want me to do design for them. I'm definitely not short of work, but I appreciate the support).\u000a\u000a\u000aI should probably declare my major soon, shouldn't I? I've done the hard part: reflecting on what I actually want to do with it and therefore determining what sort of classes and education I need to go through. "User Interface Design Engineering" will hopefully let me put together my love of making things less frustrating to use and my obsession with making things look pretty. Viva la Photoshop!\u000a\u000aSo it's shaping up to be (another) long and busy semester. I guess I shouldn't really be surprised. Plus, once you've worked at this pace for any appreciable length of time, anything slower just seems boring. At least, that's what I keep telling myself. Winter vacation definitely didn't seem boring: late mornings, 65 degree weather, sun, movies. Hmmm, warmth. New England winters could learn a thing or two from Arizona...\u000a

aV\u000a        A big part of extracurricular student involvement at Olin is community service. One of our most active student service projects is Engineering Discovery, which seeks to bring Olin-like problem solving experiences to elementary education. I've been a core member of this group for three years now and really enjoy the challenge of helping kids conquer open-ended design problems.\u000aLast Saturday, we put on a workshop that let local 4th and 5th graders design, build, and launch their own rockets. Check out this video!\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a        Powered by a core group of 15 students this\u000ayear, Engineering Discovery develops and runs 1-3 hour educational workshops that expose kids to open-ended, hands-on projects to teach students\u000athe value and excitement of technical problem solving. Each\u000aworkshop revolves around a particular theme, such as rocket design or\u000arenewable energy. We emphasize a team-based learning environment which\u000aencourages students to collaborate and learn from each other. \u000aHere is one team of students taking a break from dropping paper models down several stories of the Academic Center to choose the right nosecone shape.\u000aAfter exploring how different design decisions might influence the rocket's height and stability in flight, each kid gets to make their own rocket.\u000aOf course, the coolest part of the day is launch time. These rockets fly up to 200+ ft and really make for a good show.\u000a\u000aOverall the workshop was a great success.\u000aYou can learn more about Engineering Discovery through our website:https://sites.google.com/site/olinengineeringdiscovery/\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aV\u000a        I spent my Spring Break in Nashville, Tennessee this year. Yeap, I visited the south to be with Nimah, my best friend from high school. She went to school with me in India, but her dad's work for Nissan brought the family to the car company's headquarters in Nashville. She now goes to school in Tennessee and I was pretty excited to go see Nashville for what it's worth.\u000aSpring Break was this past week, and being with her was a lot of fun. For one, the lack of snow or rain or anything cold and wintry, was awesome. And for another, hanging out and catching up with my best friend was what I'd hoped for. It's been a few months since I've seen her but visiting her house and the rest of her family was relaxing. And the home-cooked Indian food I got to eat: unbeatable.\u000aSo, we did a lot of shopping for one thing. The outlets, the mall, the souvenir shop on Nashville's Broadway street. And we went on a pretty sweet tour of the city too. Did you know that Coca-Cola actually started in Nashville, before it was headquartered in Atlanta? And the first ever 'mall' in the USA is in Nashville too. As is the only standing replica of the Greek Parthenon. The Bicentennial Mall (actually a park) has the rich history of Nashville inscribed all around it while the Country Music Hall of Fame celebrates it's famous starts that come from this talented city. The Jack Daniels brewery stands in the outskirts of Nashville too.\u000aHere are some pictures of the area:\u000aFrom the top-left going counterclockwise: I posed in front of some souvenirs; the South is known for its Bluegrass music; Nimah and I in the park; Nimah looks up at the replica of the Greek Parthenon.\u000aAnd the southern food you may ask? Unfortunately being vegetarian, I wasn't able to make the most of it. But my friend, she's been eating fried chicken to her heart's content! I guess it goes to show that when Casey ('13), a native from Tennessee, reprimanded me for going to the South and being vegetarian, I should have heeded his words.\u000aI ended the week with some mini-golfin' and go-kartin' with Nimah and her younger brother. Guess who won in both games? ...yeah, her younger brother did. We got a bit upstaged there.\u000aBut all in all, my trip was awfully relaxing and fun. And this week has put me right back into work-mode at Olin. The weekend starts soon though, that will be nice...\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aYesterday was a beautiful day. It was a day that screamed for you to take a walk outside. It was a day where you could wear flip flops once more, and even walk barefoot if you wanted to. Yesterday reminded us that spring is almost here, at last. As nice as spring weather is, let's just take a moment to reminisce about the snow. As cold and bothersome as the winter can be, the snow has given us Oliners quite a few memories. The snow has brought us together during giant fort building days and pitted us against each other for snowball fights. It has forced us to shovel cars and made us go numb but also let us have fun. Yes, I admit I'm a Californian who might find snow more fascinating, but I still think snow has brought some interesting times to all of us here at Olin.\u000aGiant Snowman One: Remember the first giant snowman built this winter? The one that was about 10 feet tall and didn't get knocked down by anyone? If you were a part of this building team, congratulations!\u000aGiant Fort One: This was the first giant fort, built the exact same time as the first giant snowman! It required a dozen people, some several hours, and giant blocks of ice. It became tall enough to successfully hide several people inside of it, and whatever else people decided to hide inside...\u000aWrecking Ball, Giant Snowman Two: I think we can all say we remember this snowman. He started off as another giant 10 foot snowman braving the cold, until he was broken down by some fellow Babsoners in a very interesting way. The video of the snowman being broken apart, overlaid with "Wrecking Ball" is a true treasure. In fact, it inspired my Software Design team to create a video game in which the objective is to defend the Olin Snowman from the Babsoners. Lose, and you witness the wrecking ball scene once more.\u000aCandidate Bonding Fort: Of course, we had to show our candidates the Olin fort building spirit. Candidates weekend two, a bunch of Oliners and candidates got together to create another giant fort. Snow brought us together, you see?\u000aSnowball Fights, Snow Angels, and Games: Last but not least, we've had some great games in the snow. Whether you played football, made snow angels, or threw snowballs at your friends (or enemies), snow brought you some fun (and hopefully friendly) competition.\u000aClearly, snow has been a tool for some great adventures. Now it's time to say goodbye to the snow, but I'm sure we'll find other ways to create interesting memories. Until next year, let's always remember what snow brought us. Goodbye snow, and see you again next year.\u000a

aV\u000a     Well, it's that time of year again. Crunch time. For me, the crunch is quite literal. I am building a bridge out of spaghetti. When everything starts breaking down into late nights of gluing strands of spaghetti together to make compression members for my bridge, trying to hit that high A note in PowerChords on minimal sleep, designing and redesigning a Rubik's Cube that can solve itself, it can get people pretty down in the dumps, it can make people lose confidence in themselves.\u000a\u000a Truss Compression members for a spaghetti bridge design project in Mechanics of Solids and Structures\u000a     All of that in mind, it's tough. I'm tired. I know I over committed this semester. But I can't wait. Because the work pays off. After everything that I'm going through, after all of the hard work, the accomplishment that follows rivals no other feeling. The feeling of crossing the finish line in a race you thought you couldn't win. I know that at the end of all of this, I will have conquered some truly challenging tasks, things that I never thought that I would be able to do, and that makes everything worth it. Because instead of banging my head against a textbook late at night, cramming for a test which I'll probably forget all about, I am doing things that I love, no matter how much time I spend doing them. I am being the creative and innovative person that I want to be, instead of the bogged down, stressed out student with too many tests to study for.\u000aThe external view of a self-solving Rubik's Cube I am designing, in which a user can pick it up, scramble it, and watch as it unscrambles itself.\u000a     I just came back from a late night of designing and assembling a bridge made out of spaghetti. By Monday, I will have finished the full design for a self-solving Rubik's Cube that someone can pick up, scramble, and put down just to watch as it solves itself. I am neck deep in post-its, working to design a collaboration space for recreational mathematicians. In Olin's Robotic Sailing team, we are pushing through some of the final steps it takes to complete our boat, and every member of the team is giving it more than they've got.\u000aThe Robotic Sailing Team's boat from last year: Blackbody Radiation\u000a     No matter how late I stay up, I can't wait. I can't wait until I have the memory of picking up the Rubik's Cube I designed, scrambling it, and watching it work. I can't wait until I watch the bridge I built out of spaghetti spectacularly fail under the load I worked to calculate. I can't wait to treasure the moment when I help put this year's robotic sailboat in the water, push it off, and watch it sail off with a mind of its own. Even though these memories haven't happened yet, these moments are the ones that affirm my passion and love for engineering, innovation, and creativity. These are moments I know I will treasure because I helped make the impossible possible.\u000a-Alex\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGreetings!\u000aFirst, I must apologize.  I am tardy in publishing this - I actually wrote it weeks ago, then realized I hadn't uploaded the necessary photos from my camera, then procrastinated, then uploaded them, then forgot about this post, then was a bridesmaid in my older brother's wedding, then I was bored one day and checked the student blog...  And here I am.\u000a\u000aBridesmaids (me, left, with my younger sister).\u000aThis is, roughly, a four part post.  Part I is my final digital photography project.  Part II is about my triumphant (and jet-lagged) return to the United States.  Part III is a brief farewell to the Class of 2008, plus some photos from commencement.  Part IV is about my future plans (the summer and into next year, a bit).  Read on if you dare; it's a bit of a hodgepodge.\u000a        \u000aPart I: My Final Digital Photography Project\u000aI thought this might be enjoyable.  I did this project for a digital photography course at John Cabot University in Rome, Italy. The requirements were that it had to include 10-20 photos, put into slideshow form with words and music to enhance their meaning. My "theme" was less of a theme and more of just an idea: that each picture is somehow like another picture that I have taken, and so in this slideshow, each picture is linked to the one before it and the one after it. It is thus titled (extremely creatively, I must say) "Associations."  All photos were taken in Italy, Germany, the UK, and France.  James Whong (Olin Class of 2009) provided (composed, created) the music for this video.\u000aYou can see the video here (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wt0FxNt6UZQ).\u000aPart II: My Return to America\u000aAfter four full months abroad, I have returned to my fair country.  When I arrived in Rome, I was expecting some amount of culture shock; I did not, however, expect any noticeable reverse culture shock.  I felt so ready to return home - I didn't expect things to feel so strange.  I made a list recently of everyday things that now feel strange and exciting; I shall now reproduce it below...\u000a1. The US dollar.\u000aGlorious!  But also a little strange.  American money is weirdly all the same size and color (mostly); I always have a bit of a shock when I open my wallet.\u000a2. Drinking fountains.\u000aThey are all at a reasonable drinking height (for me), point in the correct direction (that is, upward and toward my mouth), and have a button to push to turn them on and off, so as not to waste water unnecessarily.  Italian drinking fountains are not so - they are often below my hip, point straight downward, and run continuously.  It's very odd.  Dogs drink from them quite a lot.\u000a3. The dryer.\u000aAs in the washer and dryer. In Rome I only had a washer. It took only 3.5 kg loads (that is, very small loads), and over an hour and a half to finish a cycle (it feels very strange to use the past tense for those statements). At home we have a washer AND a dryer - my clothes were washed and dried within two hours!  Fantastic.\u000a4. Big cars.\u000aThere are vans and SUVs everywhere here...  I'm used to SmartCars and Cooper Minis and Vespas.  It's strange.  Additionally, the abundance of parking space, sidewalks, and wide streets feels unfamiliar.\u000a5. English spoken in restaurants...  And everywhere.\u000aI went out to dinner with my parents, and was, quite frankly, shocked when the waiter approached the table and addressed us in English.  I was fully expecting him to say "ciao," and was prepared to respond in kind.  The "hi" we got instead threw me completely off balance.\u000a6. Portion sizes.\u000aAmericans eat a lot.  American restaurants serve a lot of food.  And although here it is quite standard to take leftovers home and eat them later, the portions are nonetheless enormous.  Italian restaurants serve less food, and over multiple courses.  Italians take much longer to eat - the point of going out to dinner, after all, is not just for the food, but also for the company - and the waiters and waitresses are never in much of a rush, either.  Italians end up eating, usually, less food over a much longer period of time than Americans.\u000a7. My friends and family!\u000aIt's a little weird to be back...  But really great at the same time.\u000aPart III: Farewell to the Class of 2008\u000a\u000aCiao everybody!  :)  You will be missed.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMatt is himself.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBeth and Simone look on in amusement.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMeena and Tiana are happy to be graduating.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSeniors do the wave.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe seniors (including Jon and Katie, above) make their way to the commencement tent, and there is much rejoicing.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAnthony, ready for action.\u000aPart IV: Future plans\u000aStarting in June, I'll begin my summer internship: working for iRobot, the company that makes the Roomba (among other robots).  Basically, I get to play with robots all summer.  I'm pretty excited.  I'll be living in an apartment in Somerville, near Davis Square (right next to Tufts University) with four guys from Olin's class of 2009.  I've been officially designated as The Mom: "Do your dishes!"  "Stop playing video games!"  It will be...  Interesting.\u000a\u000a\u000aNext year will be my last at Olin (how strange).  I've been chosen to chair Olin's Student Activities Committee (SAC), the (maybe) largest and (definitely) wealthiest committee on campus, and it's entirely student-run (though I think we technically have a staff adviser - the Assistant Dean of Student Life).  SAC basically throws a lot of cool events.  We had our first planning meeting last week with all the new upperclassmen/women members (first-years will be encouraged to apply in the fall), and, well, I'm really excited for next year.\u000a\u000a\u000aAdditionally, I'll be taking a full 16 credits each semester (including SCOPE), writing for the blog, and applying to graduate schools and scholarships/fellowships.  I don't have any idea which ones; I haven't really decided my long-term plans yet.  Yikes.\u000a\u000a\u000aCheers, and have a great summer!\u000a\u000a\u000aAngela\u000a\u000a\u000aPS: Hi Mrs. Yarak!\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aNow that it's almost time to start packing bags to go back to school, I wanted to share a fun lesson from this summer. First, I'd like to stress that this lesson was inspired not by lessons from many a movie that "no one's going to marry a girl that can't even make round chappatis", nor by my mother's constant coaxing. Instead, this facebook group, titled "If all else fails in life, open a roti stand" is the source of my motivation to finally learn to make chappatis this summer.\u000aHere are some pictures documenting my progress. Initially, some of my chappatis were a little challenged in the being round department:\u000aQuite a few more weren't doing so hot on the cooking evenly test:\u000aBut finally, things started looking better! \u000a\u000aBy the end, I even got them to puff up on the open flame!\u000a\u000aThat's it for now! I'll report back once I'm all moved in to school (Aug 28/29 -- soon!). Also exciting is that the first SCOPE event for this year is going to be on August 31st. That's when we find out about this year's sponsors and projects.But more on all that in future entries -- for now, back to making the most of the last couple days of summer!\u000a

aV\u000aFor those of you who have never made a spontaneous buy, heartily pat yourself on the back and disregard the rest of this reminder, which was made in spirit of this holiday season.\u000aEarlier this month, I found myself on the home page of Coin, a San Francisco-based startup with its only product being a sleek, matte black card capable of storing magnetic strip information from up to 8 other cards. I scrolled down the page and the more I read, the more I was convinced that my wallet was too fat with the four cards I had (four is A LOT), that I really needed a card capable of getting rid of that ungodly weight and thickness that comes with four cards, and that I too could be as suave as the men in the promotional video, whipping out their Coin to pay for purchases. My cursor gravitated towards the "Pre-order Now" and before I knew it, I was typing my debit card information into the form.\u000aLuckily for my savings, the transaction was not approved and I shambled on down the path of post-work, online meddling (take that, procrastination!) before I could rectify my purchase. I didn't realize this until I checked my banking email account the next day. By then, I no longer wanted it and thought that it was pointless to have a card that had to be linked to my phone so that any hypothetical mugger would hypothetically have a hard time hypothetically mugging me, a card that had a life-span of two years due to an embedded battery that would power the card to let me choose amongst my four cards (no, four is not a lot), and a card whose main selling point was to reduce the thickness of my wallet.\u000aEven when I wanted the Coin, did I need it? No, and although one can make the argument that no one ever needs anything outside of necessities for basic living, purchasing the Coin was pointless for me considering I only had four cards that I would never forget at any establishment (plus many other reasons).\u000aIt's important* to differentiate between needs and wants, and this concept doesn't just apply to transactions in its most limited sense. Sure this might seem obvious, but it's easy to lose track of what is a necessity and what isn't. Since a necessity has such a mercurial definition per person, I'll leave you to decide what would be considered a stupid purchase/need. Happy deal hunting! \u000a*Unless you're rolling in dough\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aAt 10:26pm Thursday night (just short of two days before Halloween), an email landed in the inbox of every Olin first-year. The message was simple: "For 'Halloween' tomorrow, everyone go as someone else in our class."\u000a\u000aThe response was nothing short of epic.\u000a\u000aOlin's small community and freshman introductory experience allow for rapid bonding and spontaneity (understatement of the day?), but I was still in awe when I woke up ten hours later to the majority of our class dressed in flawless imitations. Most people were able to identify the costume before anyone could say "switcharoo."\u000aThis all-too-common impromptu organization and the ability to impersonate a given classmate illustrate the close relationships forged in the fires of late-night homework gatherings (read: frenzied cram sessions), as well as the unique population here at Olin. Apparently, there is something at this school for everybody, and a little bit of that "everybody" decides to attend, creating a veritable smorgasbord of personalities. The distinct characters shine on their own, yet manage to blend into a vibrant (albeit often silly) composite. I can't imagine the group functioning any other way, quirks and all.\u000a\u000aPhotos (courtesty of Allen '13) explain this dynamic best. See if you can pick out the swaps!\u000a\u000aThe majority of our class (in a muddled state):\u000a\u000a\u000aAaron juggling. In a skirt:\u000a\u000aTim and Tom (roommate swap):\u000a\u000aKory and I went for the Midwestern switcharoo (yes, that's a homemade cheesehead):\u000a\u000aBen and Jeff (Honestly, I'm surprised Jeff let his beloved Yankees apparel out of his sight):\u000a\u000aRachel, Jessica, and Emily pulled off a three-way switch (Snuggie included!):\u000a\u000aThis one just confuses me.

aV\u000aOne of the things Olin encourages students to do is pursue activities outside of academics.  This quickly becomes apparent through interactions on campus and with our admissions department.  Anyway, although the college does sometimes provide funding and credit for these activities during the semester, sometimes it's nice to get away from Olin too.  While I was on Spring break I took the time to finish up my SCUBA* diving certification. \u000aA brief description: over winter break I attended 6 hours of classroom training with my family, as well as 6 hours of pool time. You learn basic skills and how to implement them in real scenarios and then practice each skill with an instructor.  That way you won't risk injury while diving.  You're eligible to start the certification process once you're 10 years old. After you finish all of the initial training, you're supposed to go to the real world to do your "open water" certification. That basically means lake or ocean. \u000aSo, over Spring Break I went to the Bahamas to do Open Water Certification.  My parents had actually planned the vacation before we did the initial SCUBA lessons, so it just ended up being a convenient coincidence that we were staying at a dive resort, Small Hope Bay (on Andros).  I ended up doing some diving in the ocean and some in something called a "blue hole."  A blue hole is an inland lake or part of the ocean that's extremely deep.  They were generally formed by tectonic plate movement, and have multiple levels.  Initially there are about 100ft of freshwater, followed by a hydrogen sulfate zone, followed by anoxic salt water.  The different layers all have very different environments.  Obviously, as it was one of my initial dives (four are needed for certification, over two days) I was only in the fresh water region of the blue hole.  It was really interesting to see a different ecosystem whlie being certified.  Overall, learning something new and recharging for the rest of the semester at the same time seems to have been a great combination.\u000a [As a side note, I would also like to point out that I have successfully written without needing to be reminded by Jessi that it's almost Tuesday.

aV\u000aI can never decide if I love or hate this time of the semester. Hate, because this is when all the due dates converge, everyone's stressed, and all that procrastinating finally catches up with you. Love because, again, this is when all the due dates finally converge, and projects finally begin to take shape and (hopefully) materialise. Also, once all this gets done, we have a relatively low stress week with  expo and commencement to look forward to.\u000aAmong the biggest things on my plate this semester is a project for my Digital VLSI course. The goal of this project is to design and layout an integrated circuit of some sort, which we then get fabricated through MOSIS. My teammate and I are working on putting together a simple CMOS image sensor, which I'm pretty excited about. To be honest I was pretty nervous going into this project, both in terms of content and scope of the project. Many many hours and transistors later, now that the finish line is in sight, I'm pleasantly surprised, and maybe even satisfied with how much we have learnt and gotten done. Aah, I just LOVE this feeling towards the end of a project!\u000aAnother project I just got done with was a paper for a finance course I'm taking at Babson College. This one was quite the monument towards developing effective teamwork abilities. Our team was comprised of six people (BIG!), three of whom were Olin students, and three of whom were Babson students. Scheduling time with just three Olin students at this time of the year is an ordeal enough, but bringing in another three students from a different school with a different approach to work made it all that much more of a challenge. Turning that paper in came with another one of those "whoa, that actually came together" moments, and hey, I know how to use Bloomberg now!\u000aProjects aside, I attended a session with our college's President's Council, as well as a meeting for a Board of Trustees committee that I served as a student rep. on this past Monday. One of the primary questions we were attempting to address with these conversations was, quite literally, "what's so special about Olin College?"\u000a        This stems from the fact that for the first couple years, attending Olin was marketed as an opportunity to help build a new college. Now that we almost have multiple (TWO!) graduating classes, an existent school, and maybe even some history and tradition, has this changed? What sets us apart now, if anything?\u000aOne pretty common answer to that question when asked of community members is "the people." While I agree on a lot of levels, I've always had my thoughts regarding this is something the world beyond the "Olin bubble" will understand. It was pretty exciting to hear a number of visitors from industry and other institutions agree with that answer, and refreshing to hear the external perspective on Olin and our education -- all pretty thought provoking, but all these thoughts have gotta go on hold for another week, until the semester actually gets done.\u000aBack to work for me now, thanks for reading!\u000a- Meena\u000a

aV\u000aWarning: this post contains adult language, as does the Penny Arcade comic to which I link.\u000aExecutive Summary\u000aIn a community that values and strives to uphold the principles of integrity, respect for others, and patience and understanding, the existence of an e-mail list dedicated to anonymous, angry ranting seems absurd.  And yet it exists, in all its insidious, toxic glory.\u000aIntroduction\u000aWell-versed internet users may be familiar with the Penny Arcade comic on the internet and anonymity (http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19). The general idea is that any normal person, when allowed to write things anonymously for an audience to read, will easily become a complete and utter, ah, jerkface. Olin students are in no way immune to this phenomenon, as evidenced by the conduct I have observed--frequently--on our two anonymous e-mail lists.\u000aThe Olin College Honor Code: A Brief Overview\u000aOlin's community naturally differs from the greater internet community, however, in that all students sign and agree to live by the Honor Code, promising to respect our peers and treat one another with patience and understanding (among other things).\u000aThe Purpose of the Honor Code (found in the Olin College Student Handbook) states the following:\u000a\u000aA fundamental element of Olin's culture is trust, made possible by the Honor Code's requirement that all community members strive to conduct themselves with honor and integrity. ...  At Olin, we ask our students to engage in the hard work of figuring out how to translate values into action.  (http://www.olin.edu/student_life/pdfs/student_handbook.pdf)\u000aTranslating values into action does not mean abandoning the Honor Code whenever an opportunity to be an anonymous jerkface arises.  E-mails one writes are just as real as words that one says--they are actions.\u000aThe Olin College Honor Code itself states the following:\u000a\u000aAs a member of the Olin College community, I will strive to embody the spirit of honor and integrity... and will take action to address any breach of that spirit. Each member of the college community will accept responsibility for and represent accurately and completely oneself, one's work, and one's actions...  Each member of the college community will express a personal commitment to the welfare of the community through a spirit of cooperation [and] concern for others...  Each member of the college community will strive to foster harmonious relationships through empathy and mindfulness of others.  (http://www.olin.edu/student_life/pdfs/student_handbook.pdf)\u000aDistinct from many other "Honor Code" colleges, the majority of Olin's students assert that the Honor Code "actually works."  If this claim is true, why are we largely unperturbed by the existence of the Therapy mailing list?  Therapy allows and even encourages behavior that obviously counters the Honor Code and its principles.  Explain to me how anonymously calling another list member a "fuckwad" is striving to foster harmonious relationships.  If you want another, less obscene option, show me how the post sent in May that simply read, "Women be crazy" (no punctuation) embodies empathy and mindfulness of others.   If you can do it, I will be more than impressed.\u000aAnonymous E-mail Lists at Olin College: An Overview\u000aOlin has a number of e-mail lists--288 at last count, though many are obsolete or used very infrequently--that students can join; two of these are anonymous.  Both anonymous e-mail lists (Sexuality and Therapy, both completely opt-in, and encompassing--probably--less than a third or a fourth of the student population) were created during my time at Olin.  Sexuality was the first, created by the president of the newly-formed Taboo Club. Sexuality's list info page says the following under the "About" section:\u000a\u000aThis list serves as a discussion and club-coordination forum for the Taboo Club. Taboo was born out of a desire to promote frank and open discussion of sexual topics in a safe, non-judgmental environment. This interest in discussion led to an interest in promoting sexual education in the Olin community, and to the celebration and expression of the intricacies of sex in the modern world. Discussion of sexuality is not simply limited to sex itself, but also includes analysis of cultural stereotypes, the modern sex-negative status quo and how it developed, conditioned views of sex, and modern reformative movements and literature. The founders of this club would like to remove the taboos surrounding sexual discussion, and this is their first step.\u000aNew Taboo Club members will be contacted by a club officer before their membership status is confirmed so that they understand the club mission, appropriate e-mail etiquette, and the sensitivity of the topics being discussed.\u000aThere are 4 basic ground rules:\u000a1) This list may contain members that are under 18 years of age. Therefore, do not embed pornographic images in e-mails. You may link to pornographic material, but indicate the content of the link beforehand.\u000a2) Please try to make subject lines "safe for work", so you don't unnecessarily offend someone who may glance at your Outlook e-mail pop-ups.\u000a3) Please try to summarize the content of your e-mail in the first line of your e-mail. This will help keep people comfortable, as they get to opt-in to a discussion instead of having to read something they may not be interested in.\u000a4) Please clearly label joke e-mails that might be construed as offensive or alarming.\u000aThis list is completely opt-in. The list is anonymous, in that when a member sends an e-mail to the list, the sender's name is replaced with [e-mail list address]. However, in cases of emergency, there are provisions for identifying the sender of an e-mail (see Anonymity Policy below). You may choose to include a "signature" to identify your e-mails and allow people to contact you directly, but that is entirely optional. The list is also unmoderated, so please use your discretion when posting. If you cannot abide by these rules, you can unsubscribe. If the list gets out of hand, it can and will be shut down.\u000aNote that this description has been substantially expanded from its original form, but its spirit and intentions have not changed.\u000aInitially, the list worked wonderfully, and was used for its exact purpose: inquisitive, respectful, and thoughtful discussion, as well as some general club planning.  As time went on, however, and a new class of students entered Olin, the list's purpose began to fade to the background behind purposely disrespectful, inane, inflammatory, hostile, or otherwise counterproductive posts.  "Flame wars" became a common occurrence, frustrating many students to the point of abandoning the list in droves, but also amusing at least a few, causing two such students to spontaneously start a second e-mail list dedicated to--basically--thoughtless ranting: Therapy.\u000aTherapy was created more as a joke than anything else.  It quickly became far worse--more inflammatory, hostile, and counterproductive--than the sexuality list had been.  One of Therapy's creators has since referred to it as a "cesspit," which I feel is rather apt (though the same creator also asserts that Therapy has had some "very good discussion" in the past, which I cannot deny).  Therapy's list info page states the following under the "About" section:\u000a\u000aIt was once pointed out that Oliners sometimes crave anonymity. That's what this list is for - complain, scream and whine all you like.\u000aRULES:\u000a1) You're anonymous. This comes with two caveats: don't say who you are when you're bitching, and don't try to guess who everyone else is. If you want a rule of thumb: if YOUR post is anonymous, then everyone you talk about should be too. If you want to give away your name and be open to the proverbial sticks and stones, that's your problem.\u000a2) You're welcome to be a huge jerk here. That's the point. But this rule comes with a clarification. When I say "jerk," I mean you can scream, cuss and be as impolite as you like. This isn't meant to contradict the respect clause of the honor code - be a jerk about opinions and ideas, not about people. And don't name names, or pseudonyms, or whatever clever thing you might think of.\u000a3) What goes on in Therapy stays in Therapy.\u000a4) Refer to Penny-Arcade's Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory with any questions.\u000ahttp://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19\u000aThe general spirit of this description, especially when compared to that of the sexuality list, clearly induces a different sort of behavior.  Thoughtful discussion is never mentioned or even hinted at--there is no purpose in mind other than simply blowing off steam.  What happened to punching bags, jogging, and ranting to one's friends?  And then there are the rules, which seem intended to prevent disaster rather than to encourage responsible, respectful, and thoughtful behavior.  Note that rule number 2 was amended (the third through fifth sentences are new) after Therapy members used its original phrasing taken to the logical extreme--that is, that it was permissible to be a huge jerk to other Olin students when posting to the list.  Other list members pointed out that the Honor Code applies to e-mail as well as other conduct, and the list's creators expanded and clarified the rule.\u000aRule number 3 is absurd.  In fact, I have knowingly violated it in this very post.  I am prepared to face the consequences of my actions (and words). I justify such rule-breaking in the following way (as, indeed, I am a member of the list, and therefore ought to abide by its rules): I am not, as you may have guessed, fond of Therapy.  I therefore feel no qualms in publicly disparaging it.  (I joined it out of curiosity.  I wish I hadn't.  Thanks to reading its frequent and life-wasting threads, I have developed a vendetta against it.)  The list of Therapy members is only available to the list administrators, and thus I can reveal the identity of nobody other than myself; to do otherwise would be profoundly uncool.  We should all be answerable to our own actions; anonymity and rules such as rule number 3 remove this accountability.  Rule number 3 counters my sense of rightness, and I cannot abide by it.  Thus I continue my moral crusade against Olin's anonymous e-mail lists unhindered by ethical qualms about rule-breaking.  As the old adage goes, all is fair in war and internets.\u000aAlthough these two lists presented themselves in dramatically different manners--one serious, one laughable--the resultant discussions all tended toward the same place, and away from the Honor Code.  (To be fair, however, the reforms that the Taboo club enacted seem to have helped significantly; Therapy's very slight reforms have helped, well, very slightly.)\u000aAm I innocent of sending such counterproductive e-mails?  No.  I've sent some e-mails that I am completely embarrassed to have written.  How did it happen to me?  I'm still not entirely sure.  I refer myself to the Penny Arcade comic in order to answer that question (though, as you may have noticed, contrary to the assertion of Therapy rule number 4, the comic is not overly helpful).  About a year ago, I started signing all e-mails that I sent to either list in order to make myself accountable for my words.  A few others take such action, and the smarter ones unsubscribe from the list.  Once I overcome my own morbid fascination with it, I too will unsubscribe.\u000aHonor and Anonymity\u000aHonor and anonymity simply do not mesh.  The cowardly and disrespectful behavior that anonymity allows, encourages, and perhaps even causes violates our core values.  Such e-mails truly undermine the sense of trust in our small community.  The Honor Code and the sense of trust it promotes are things that Olin students certainly claim to value--many even say that such trust is their favorite aspect of Olin's student life.\u000aSo why does Therapy still exist?  I will attempt to answer this question, but the true answer is that I do not know, and I often ask myself that same question.\u000aMy attempted answer is this: many Olin students do not care.  The students who wrote the Honor Code have long since graduated, and each entering class seems to find it less and less important and relevant--it has become something that should only be used in extreme and otherwise unresolvable circumstances.  The Honor Board and the act of reporting a student for a suspected Honor Code violation are tossed around fairly frequently on Therapy, as though they are some sort of joke--as though ridiculing a document that Olin students have written for the betterment of other Olin students is really going to stick it to "The Man."  I think, dear Therapy, that the joke is on us.\u000aDo Something\u000aSo, few Olin students who may be reading this, here is your call to action: Olin is our own school.  To a certain degree, we can do what we want with it.  What do you want to do with it?\u000aWe don't have to abolish Therapy, clearly; it's existed this long without having been destroyed.  However, the fact that we still tolerate it is insufficient justification for its continued existence.  Therapy's defenders need to create a compelling argument for why we should preserve it, as well as a plan for how it can endure without consistently encouraging students to violate the Honor Code.\u000aMy vote? Abolish it.\u000aTo my classmates: regardless of Therapy's existence status, I challenge you to always hold yourself accountable for your own words and actions, and to encourage others to do the same.  Only we can create a community of trust--and only we can destroy it.\u000aI will close with an e-mail that is about to happen on Therapy.  Clearly it is not staying on Therapy.  Consider rule number 3 officially broken--for roughly the fourth time so far today.\u000aDear Therapy:\u000aI wrote a blog post that you aren't going to like.\u000a--Angela\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aTurkeyorking: (n) the name given by Arash (Olin '11) to the adventure of going to New York City for a few days over Thanksgiving Break. See also Turkeyork (City).\u000aI needed to offer this definition because that's what I did last weekend: I hopped on a bus to NYC for a weekend of complete and utter debauchery (okay, not really) before seeing my family for the Thanksgiving Holiday. I hadn't planned on going, but one day my friend came up to me and said "I heard you were going to NYC for Thanksgiving." I hadn't even though about it, but the seed was planted and so it happened. It was totally and completely amazing. However, this story is best told through pictures, so I'll just fill in the blanks on the very rare occurances where I forgot to break out the camera.\u000a\u000aThis is me standing in front of the O-so-sketchy Fung Wah bus. This bus runs between the Chinatowns in Boston and New York for $15 each way, making it affordable for students like me. If you want to know more, see the Wikipedia article.\u000a\u000aThis is the cross formerly located at Ground Zero. After getting off the Fung Wah, we walked through China Town, trying to get to Wall Street, but ended up at Ground Zero instead. The site itself was not as moving as it should have been, because we were forced to look through holes in the concrete barrier, which I think was a shame.\u000a\u000aThis is my friend Alex and I being colds and wind-blown on the Staten Island Ferry, which is the way to see the Statue of Liberty on the cheap. Alex met us after we arrived, as he went down Friday to visit some friends. My friend Sarah, who came down with me, took the picture. Note the Olin hat. I had to show the colors.\u000a\u000aSarah and Alex in front of a sign that we were super excited to see. The three of us are members of the Class of 2010, and Sarah and I have both been class representatives, so collectively, we're big fans of this sign. We decided that this totally needs to be our class motto, so we started by taking a picture in front of A GIANT SIGN! Yearbook photo, anyone?\u000a\u000aEating dinner with Alex's high school friend Donna and her friend Katherine (both Barnard students). They were super awesome. Also, the college code of ethics (in this case, "if a friend is visiting your city, extend him or her your floor") allowed us to crash on Donna's floor for the night, allowing us to experience NYC with even lower costs.\u000a\u000aThe next morning we got up super early and went to Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral. The Mass itself was rather disappointing (our campus Mass has better music and sermons, trust me), but the Cathedral was amazing. To take this picture, Alex had to sprawl out on the sidewalk. It was hilarious.\u000a\u000aAfter St. Patrick's, we walked around Midtown for awhile, which was great, and then headed to the Empire State Building. This is our group photo at the top of the ESB. The guy in the yellow is Dan, a fellow Olin 2010er and NYC resident who came to hang out with us for the rest of the day.\u000a\u000aWe ended our day by playing around in Central Park. It was so much fun. By this time our numbers were 5, as Marti, another 2010er and NYC resident had joined us. Over all, it was a super trip, relatively cheap, AND SO MUCH FUN. Really, going to school on the East Coast rocks my world.\u000aAs always, thanks for reading.\u000a-Jeff Moore\u000aOlin College Class of 2010\u000a

aV\u000aI am  of the way done with college. Wow. Saying it like that makes it seem like so much has gone by. And it has! This past semester, I have: 1) Built a toy that hopped and a pangolin that crawled in Design Nature, 2) built ten circuits (well, okay, only nine...) and created a useless machine in Modeling and Control, C) learned more about the populations of sharks, rays, and scallops than anyone wants to know, researched how much caffeine will kill you, and modeled the game of billiards in Modeling and Simulation, and 4) explored Boston and the surrounding areas through an anthropological lens for my Arts, Humanities, and Social Science foundation course.\u000aAll students at Olin showcase at least one thing they are passionate about at the end of semester expo. I chose to present with my Mini Baja racing team. Mini Baja is a project team where we build and race an off road go kart. The Baja presentation was set up like an open house: people would wander in, see the car, listen to various students explain various things, and then leave. This arrangement gave the student presenters a lot of opportunities to talk to our guests. Throughout the hour long presentation, I was able to learn more about the car from other students on different sub teams. I was also able to talk to high school students and adult visitors about my experience and knowledge regarding the electrical subteam.\u000aIn addition to the Baja talk, I also performed as a part of an improv troupe called OPIUM (Olin Performance Improv Und Magick). This was only our third ever performance in front of an audience. It was all unscripted, relied on audience participation, and really could have gone anywhere. I ended up acting out the same scene as giraffes with Logan upwards of five times. Each time we performed the scene, it got progressively faster as our directors Bill and Greg wanted to see it done "in less time." What started as a two minute scene about giraffes who couldn't manage to eat leaves off trees or pick up things that had fallen on the ground ended as a one second scene involving simply Logan's tongue. There were also some amusing dead people and lots and lots of panda bears.\u000a\u000a\u000aOPIUM performing at Expo. From left to right: Ellie '17, Ryan '17, Logan '17, Me '17, Brandon '16, Greg '15, Graham '14, and Bill '16\u000aAs my winter break draws to a close and brings the beginning of next semester, I must sadly bid farewell to pass/no record and welcome real grades.\u000aHere's to a great next semester!\u000aAnd to any senior prospective students out there: enjoy your last semester of high school! Finish strong and remember, you CAN fight senioritis. Or you know, you can take a nap...\u000aLove,Meg '17\u000a

aV\u000aFirst of all, I must apologize for the delay between this post and my introductory story. Secondly, whereas my last post was very narrative in fashion, I have decided to make my next couple of posts "listicles", or a combination of a list and an article. Hopefully we'll cover more ground with fewer words. So without further ado, to Paris!\u000a\u000a\u000aParis (A)\u000aAh, Paris, such a famous city! Easily mentioned in the same breath as London or New York, a must-go destination for all travelers. Hot-spot of culture, fashion, food, ad nauseum.\u000aSort of.\u000aIn actuality, Paris is a surprisingly dirty, not desperately-pretty, unnavigable maze of pick-pockets, sprinkled with the occasional cultural landmark. The Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower are great, but Notre Dame and the Louvre spectacularly failed to live up to my expectations. London has a far better selection of cathedrals and museums with the added benefit of not having to fend off thieves on every block. There are little gems like Sainte Chapelle, but I really can't see how people would want to spend more than a few days there.\u000a\u000aThe stained glass in St. Chapelle is absolutelyextraordinary.\u000aHowever, Paris did play host to what I believe is the greatest-ever loss of the Olin Challenge when my family and I bumped into Scott Thomson and his family. On the top of the Eiffel Tower. At 11 pm at night. As you do. And whilst it was lovely chatting with them, I admit I was slightly alarmed by the distinct movement of the Tower. Between the wind and the constant movement of several hundred people, the top must sway back and forth by several feet. Which is nice. If you like heights. Which I don't.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aView of Paris from the top of the Arc de Triomphe\u000a\u000a\u000aChateau Gontier (B)\u000a\u000aLuckily, if you don't like the distinctly urban nature of Paris and are in search of something a little more provincial, a few hours drive south will land you in Chateau Gontier, which is famous for absolutely nothing at all. Just look at its Wikipedia entry. This gives it the distinct pleasure of being rustic rather than glitzy, sleepy rather than insane, and not covered in pick-pockets. It's also home to one of the quirkiest hotels I've ever stayed in (an 18th century style chateau with an interior painted in bright primary colors adorned with modern artwork) and one of the best restaurants I've ever been to (a Pizzeria started by a couple who also happen to be cinephiles, resulting in a happy combination of old movie posters and gourmet pizza).\u000aI felt that Paris was trying too hard to be like the stereotypical city we all hear about in Disney films. As a result, everything is sort of caricatured and fake. Chateau Gontier on the other hand has no such pretensions, so a crumbly old chateau on the side of a river in a town where nothing is open after 6 pm is genuinely a crumbly old chateau on the side of a river where nothing is open after 6 pm. Fabulous!\u000a\u000a\u000aOn a slightly less cultured note, at one point we were forced to eat at McDonalds (on account of the fact it was the only place open for food at 10 pm). However, it allowed for two important discoveries. First, McDonalds in Europe are much, much fancier than in the United States. The food is no better, but at least the decor tries to mask the fact. They even have these amazing computer kiosks where you can order and pay, which is great if you don't speak the language; less great if your credit card is not European. The second discovery wasn't so much a discovery as a confirmation. Anyone who's watched Pulp Fiction will know that Vincent Vega claims that the metric system is responsible for McDonalds not selling a quarter-pounder with cheese. Instead, it's a Royale with Cheese. AND HE'S RIGHT:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLe Mans (C)\u000a\u000aI'm not going to say anything about Le Mans besides a) I went there for my second time and b) if you don't know about the 24 Hours, you should. I took a bunch of photos and videos and will soon(ish) be posting a lengthy post about it on my personal blog.\u000aAmboise (E)\u000a\u000aUnfortunately we didn't have a chance to spend much time in Amboise as we left Chateau Gontier on our way to Troyes. Even still, we managed to squeak in a flying visit to the Clos de Luce, where Leonardo da Vinci lived the last three years of his life. Thus, it is also home to the da Vinci Museum and garden, which is undoubtedly one of the most interesting and tasteful museums you can ever go to. Engineers will be especially interested in the working scale models of various da Vinci sketches, from bilge pumps to wooden tanks to helicopters.\u000a\u000a\u000aOne of the few non-functional exhibits.\u000a\u000aTroyes (F)\u000a\u000aNow this place was a surprise. It's a normal, ever-day French town set in some amazingly preserved gothic architecture. Everything is beautiful and the Cathedral isunbelievable. Okay, it might not be the mostimpressive cathedral ever built in history, but it seems so unnecessarily grand in the context of the surrounding city. What's more, it's not packed like Notre Dame or other "must see" venues in France.\u000a\u000a\u000aI also sampled my first Nutella crepe in Troyes. I am a fan.\u000a\u000aSpeaking of anonymity, allow me to promote a tiny little restaurant in Troyes. It's called the Bon Vivant and it ranks somewhere in the top three places we ate at in Europe. It's very small, no more than a dozen tables. The inside is thick, exposed beams with lots of mirrors and chalk boards and odds-and-ends. The couple who run it speak no English, despite the fact that everything on the radio was modern American music. But the food - both in quality, preparation, presentation, variety, and even price - was amazing. Staggering. Utterly fabulous.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe menu said something about salmon. That's all I understood. It wasdeliciousthough.\u000a\u000a\u000aThere were more Pulp Fiction references in Troyes, too. Apparently, someone loved the movie so much they made a restaurant based on it:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEpernay (G)\u000a\u000aOur final stop before crossing the border was Epernay, famous for one thing and one thing only: champagne. So we went on a tour of the de Castellane factory and were amazed at just how much there is to know about Bubbly. The bottles need to be turned during the fermentation, a process that was only mechanized in the mid-1970s. There are actually many different kinds of champagne, meaning there's no reason why you can't pair it with food and drink it with your meal like wine. It also doesn't get better with age so now we all have the perfect excuse to drink it instead of saving it for special occasions! We left Epernay feeling a little snobby from the experience, since de Castellane is not sold in the United States. Unfortunately, our suitcases were already quite full, so there was no room to bring back a liquidsouvenir.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd that's half of the trip already done! But the best bits are yet to come. Get ready for Germany...\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aLast time I blogged, I wrote about how I was entering some work in an art show here. It turns out that four of my five pieces were selected for the show. My resume just got a little more interesting.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a         The opening itself was pretty successful. Despite the show being in a place I personally wouldn't have noticed had I been walking by, there was a fairly substantial crowd.\u000a\u000a\u000a(That's my roommate, Zoe, in the striped dress. She also had 4 pieces in the show and managed to pick up a few commissions as well. Also, I apologize for the blurriness of some of these. I was trying not to use my camera flash.)\u000aThere were enough people to totally demolish the buffet, in fact.\u000a\u000a\u000aThat was one of several tables.\u000aThe show itself was an interesting mix of styles. There were pieces that very obviously came from Angel Academy (a classical arts school here in Florence), and there were pieces that were very obviously more about commentary than technique. There were Renaissance-looking pieces and installations utilizing Flash. The more classical pieces won more of the awards, possibly due to the fact that there was only one judge, but all of the pieces seemed to be well-received.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Best in Show went to a self-portrait bust.\u000a\u000a\u000aThis is a charcoal drawing. I was blown away. It was done by a student at Angel. Apparently these take a good part of a semester, and students have to draw plaster casts for their first two years of study.\u000a\u000a\u000aThese four pieces are a sub-series of a currently uncompleted work. My friend, Shai, painted these on random cloth he found and stretched himself. He ended up selling these the first night.\u000a\u000a\u000aIn this photo, you can see two of Zoe's pieces and four from another artist who apparently wants you to plant a tree.\u000aI think the most exciting part of the night, though, was my nametag:\u000a\u000a\u000aOh. Yes.\u000aJust a few weeks left in Florence now, and only about two months left in Europe. Where did the time go?\u000a-Jessi\u000a

aV\u000aAhoy hoy!\u000a\u000aI've been at Olin for two weeks (to the day!) so far this summer, so I figured I should start getting you guys up to speed before summer disappears again.\u000a\u000aThe main reason I'm here is research: Olin is a great place to do research because the Professors really leave it up to you to get things done. Sure, they're there for help, but you have to ask for it. Also, Olin will provide free housing on top of a handsome salary. My research is on aeroelastic vibrational energy recovery. Impressive title, right? It's a slightly unusual research project because instead of continuing a previous project or starting entirely from scratch, I'm taking two pre-existing projects and (literally) gluing them together.\u000a\u000aOne project is aeroelastic flutter. This is flutter.Generally not a good thing. Several students at Olin have worked on building a jig that works with our wind tunnel to replicate flutter.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe other project is vibrational energy harvesting. I'll spare the physics lecture, but the underlying principal is that a magnet moving through a coil of wire generates electrical current. So students made a little energy harvester that works like a shock absorber, but with magnets instead of springs.\u000a\u000aCan you see where this is going? My project is to see if the vibration caused by a fluttering wing can create power. It's a neat idea because fluttering can occur at quite low speeds and doesn't require huge structures like that of wind turbines. Further more, there are hardly any moving parts, so maintenance isn't an issue like it is on traditional wind turbines.\u000a\u000aIn addition to all that, I am acting director of the Foundry and involved with one of our Summer Ventures. The Ventures Program gives people the opportunity to use the Foundry space as a summer incubator for entrepreneurial projects. Projects this year include software developing, designing a board game, and building a kinetic sculpture (I'm on that last one). It's a great chance to try your hand at entrepreneurial work, but with an Olin-provided safety net.\u000a\u000aAnd of course I'm also working for the Olinsider to let you know what Olin summer life is like. I'm living the suite life, perfecting my microwave culinary skills. I have a bunch of side-projects lined up I'd like to work on, so maybe you'll get to hear about those, too.\u000a\u000aAuf wiedersehen!\u000a\u000a-B\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aOlin has 370 students. That number may shock you, as it did for me.\u000aComing from a public high school of about 2,400 kids in Southern California, one of the few things that I was nervous about when deciding to come to Olin was definitely the size. Im used to being one in a crowd, being stuck in a system weighed down by the inertia of tradition and one-up-one-down relationships. And although I dont necessarily enjoy this kind of environment, I was more than nervous about coming to a much smaller school, and how that would affect not only me, but also the characteristics of my peers and environment as a whole.\u000aAs a first year student at Olin, everything about how I view schooling in both an educational and environmental sense has drastically changed.\u000aI feel like Olin is inherently hard to explain because it truly is so different, but here I go anyway.\u000a370 means you can change things that you feel should be changed. My professors constantly ask students about how classes might be improved to help students better understand and engage with the content. Surveys polling the student body about how they feel about X project, Y idea, or Z class influence how Olin functions on the whole and permeate day-to-day life. Opt-in social experiments with large discussions are not uncommon, and often start ripple effects that continue to affect the Olin community long after the experiment ends. Oliners are so inspired to be the change that they would like to see rather than to hold a grudge or simply complain. At Olin you can make a huge difference with just a couple of students and an idea, which is really empowering. This, coupled with Olins limited social inertia and a community thats incredibly receptive to feedback and change, is a recipe for fluidity beyond belief.\u000a\u000aCasually covering one of our R2s (Olins equivalent of RAs, except instead of enforcing rules, theyre just meant to be there for you) in a massive piles of leaves Dont mind us.\u000a370 means that you know almost every Oliner within a couple of weeks after arriving on campus. In general, the group of friends that you interact with on a daily basis at Olin will actually be larger than it might be at larger schools, because at larger schools, people tend to cling to a certain group of people that they feel comfortable with. For the most part, Olin is your group of people you feel comfortable with. The support network that you have here is so vast, and everyone legitimately wants to help each other out, whether it be personal, academic, or any other issue you might be working through. If you want to learn something or reach out for help, theres going to be someone there that can teach you whatever you want to know  perks of having a whole bunch of smart people that are so passionate about everything they do all concentrated in one place, right? From seniors to freshmen, professors to administrators, Oliners seriously care about each others wellbeing, and will do everything in their power to help a friend.\u000a370 also means that Olin can feel very small. Anonymity is difficult to find, which is definitely a new experience for me. Despite my previous educational environments, however, Ive been surprisingly comfortable. Our small size also means that its inevitable that there wont be the same number of physical opportunities here (in particular, space-based resources, like research labs in particular fields), but if theres something you really think the college would benefit from, there will be a whole line of people that are waiting to listen to you, from students to professors to administrators.\u000a\u000aMore autumn funtimes with other first years who have never experienced the wonder of leaf piles before  Im not alone!\u000a370 to me means friendship and trust, and an environment where I really feel I can grow into myself more, whatever that means  but thats a discussion for another time.\u000a\u000aPhoto credits for this blog go to William Lu' 18. Thanks, William!\u000aNote from the Admission Office: The total enrollment at Olin for Fall 2015 is 370 students. 333 are degree-seeking students, 10 are visiting or exchange students, and 27 are cross-registered students from other institutions taking classes at Olin.\u000a

aV\u000aMy roommate Anne (from Jeff's infamous "Happy Birthday" story) and I have discovered very quickly that applying to graduate schools, outside of the stress and agony, can be a very profitable experience. This past weekend for instance, we both got flown out to the exciting city of West Lafayette, Indiana for a grad. school expo at Purdue University. Unfortunately my first trip to the mid-west was cut short by flight delays, and we ended up spending less than 24 hours total on Purdue's campus. But being the resourceful, opportunity-driven Olin students that we are, we decided to skimp on sleep to pack in a sneak preview of Purdue social life, time with both our high school friends, a meaty self lead campus tour (at 6am), dinner at an all you can eat buffet (mm, most important), as well as a day's worth of conference activities -- all between getting there at 8:30pm one day, and leaving at 3pm the next.\u000aIt was interesting to catch up with my high school friends studying engineering at Purdue -- needless to say, both our academic and social experiences are a little different, given the differences in age/ size/ tradition/ everything between our respective institutions, both having their own advantages and disadvantages. At the end of the day, I think it really just comes down to the type of person you are, and how you learn. I know that if my friend had ended up at a place like Olin, just the smallness would have driven him nuts. I know that I would probably have been fine at a bigger school, but am definitely happier, especially with respect to academics, at a small school right now. Sure, sometimes the social aspects of it get a little constricting -- more so the older you get, I'm finding -- but I think it's been more than well worth it for the academic experience. But I've done this once, and I'll be fine with a small program, but I'm definitely going for a BIG place for grad. school.\u000aEnough talk -- now, for the obligatory photo gallery.\u000a        \u000aAnne & Meena Rock Purdue. Teehee!Also exciting/ scary, it turns out that Midwest Connect flies some TINY planes. I got to ride a Beech 1900C, a propeller plane that seats 19 passengers. We could barely stand up straight on the inside -- scary! Me with the tiny plane!\u000aAlso check out this cool New York Times Magazine article about Olin, and the way engineering is taught here. It's been three years, but it's still so exciting to see our little school get the recognition it deserves. :o)That's it for now!\u000aBest,\u000a- Meena\u000a

aV\u000aAlright, I've been meaning to write this one for some time, so I hope I can do it justice. The disclaimer, of course, is that this is just my experience with drinking culture at Olin. I am not around it enough to be an expert, nor can anyone deny that I am an eternal optimist, so I could have a very naive view of things. The hope, of course, is that those wonderful Olin students who read this blog regularly will correct me with their comments.\u000aI am not a drinker. Though I've never been a drinker, it was during my sophomore year of high school that I decided that alcohol was not my thing and that I wouldn't take part in it during high school, college, or beyond. I have my own reasons for this decision, that don't belong on this blog, and those that do drink should not think that I view myself as any better than them. It's just not my thing.\u000aSo naturally, coming to college was going to be something...different. Whereas in high school I was able to go to school during the day and escape to my social group of choice or my family at night, a college as small as Olin did not seem like a place where you could escape from much. I was a little bit worried, but trusted myself to make the best of whatever situation I found myself in. Luckily, I arrived in, what I now consider, a best-case scenario.\u000aThe official stance of the school of alcohol is "drinking is illegal if you are under 21, so don't" but the unofficial stance is "drink safely and respectfully." Further, Olin is an Honor Code school and, even more significantly, we observe and uphold ours religiously. This means that we are actually very good at being respectful. The general rule of thumb is that parties should have their doors closed and make sure not to disturb their neighbors. In my experience (at least last year in the freshmen-sophomore dorm), this is almost always followed. Save for the first month of school (when people let a little too loose) I never ran into anyone drunk in the halls or lounges, and I probably walked by plenty of parties on plenty of Saturday nights without even knowing it. Trust me, if you want to avoid alcohol, as I did during first and most of second semester, it is super easy and never invasive.\u000aWhat's more, we're also very safe about what we do here. Though many freshmen groaned about it at the time, and it did seem pretty awkward, every student who comes through Olin takes an alcohol safety course. This course, called TIPPS, teaches you how to be responsible around alcohol and how to look after your friends. It's really very helpful. Of course, such a class could go in one ear and out the other, but it doesn't seem to here. I have great respect for our pseudo-frat here, Man Hall, that hosts the most active and well attended parties. These organizers really know what they're doing. My understanding is that the Man Hall bartenders stay sober so that they can remember who has had how many drinks and can cut them off when appropriate. They also assign chaperones or at least keep a careful eye on newer attendees to ensure that they can handle alcohol responsibly. This is not your normal college party, but a very close, careful community of people looking out for each other and keeping each other from doing stupid things. That's certainly not to say that no one has any fun; on the contrary people have plenty of fun, and are able to do so safely.\u000aWhich brings me to my first actual party. A few days after I got elected to E-Board, there was a Man Hall party with most of the past and just elected E-Board in attendance (basically everyone but me). Anthony (our Vice President of Campus Life) calls me up and tells me that the two E-Boards a have a little ceremony, and that he would really like me to come. Well, I'd been meaning to drop by a Man Hall party for some time, just to see what was up, and this gave me the perfect opportunity. I arrived and had a shot of Coca-Cola. I then stayed for the rest of the party and found it to be a very chill environment. People mostly already knew that I didn't drink, and even if they offered me something, I just had to say no once and they were cool. I had such a great, pressure-free time that I dropped by the next one two weeks later. This summer I am also periodically dropping by a regular Friday-night gathering at one of the off-campus apartments a few students are staying it. It's called Beef+Beer, though I mostly just participate in the former. It's pretty awesome.\u000aSo the moral of the story? First, I find the drinking culture at Olin to be safe, non-invasive, and pressure-free. It's amazing. Second, college parties can be for drinkers and non-drinkers alike, so don't limit yourself socially. It is nice to interact with all parts of the community.\u000a \u000aThe two E-Boards being goofy. My shot glass (of water, possibly) is purely for comic effect, of course. Oh, and those dratted ears keep finding their way onto my head. (Taken on Anthony or Angela's camera).\u000a\u000aJust because I had nowhere else to put it, this is the two E-Boards going out to Indian food. It was soooooooo good. And no fuzzy ears!! (Taken on Angela's camera).\u000aThanks, as always, for reading.\u000a-Jeff Moore, Olin College Class of 2010\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aAs you all probably know by now, last weekend was Candidates' Weekend I for the class of 2013. There are a lot of things going on in the candidates' schedules--I'd guess that the sheer number of scheduled activities for the candidates rivals most students' busier days.\u000aOn Saturday, while students are rotating through their individual interviews, CORe, under the guidance of Nick '11, puts together a club fair called Olin Unplugged. There, candidates can preview Olin's clubs and organizations, and see a variety of wacky activities, like unicycle hockey, that one suspects don't happen all that often when outsiders aren't watching.\u000aSince my freshman year, I've been representing one of Olin's most active clubs at the club fair. What kind of club is it, you ask? Well, look at our club fair table:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFig. 1: What are gays? We just don't know.\u000a\u000aA surprising number of candidates last weekend came up and asked us what sort of club we are, even after seeing our rainbow-festooned table, which is why I thought it might be good to make the following points:\u000aThis club is Open, the queer student group at Olin and Babson.\u000aYes, Olin has queer people (beyond just the gay men pictured!). We're a small but close-knit group.\u000aDucker '09 wrote a pretty good post back in 2007 that spells out Open's activities in more detail.\u000aAnd finally, yeah that's me in the poster for our drag show.\u000aHopefully this clears things up for yall. And please, don't hesitate to email me or email Open if you have any questions about queer life at Olin. I promise we're friendly, and able to promptly answer email!\u000a-Roland '10\u000a

aV\u000aSo one of my roommate's parents are in town and we spent the afternoon touring around the Citadel (a major tourist attraction in Cairo) with them.  Talking with her parents, who had never been to Cairo before, made me realize how much I've adapted to life here.  I no longer worry about basic things like hailing a cab or buying food and I've grown to tolerate a lot of Cairo's more irritating idiosyncrasies like the congestion, smog, and harassment much better.  But when I was talking with her dad about living in Cairo and he asked me what I missed from the US while living in Cairo and what I would miss from Cairo once I returned to the US it sort of floored me.  I guess I'd thought about it before, but I couldn't really come up with anything to say at the time so it got me thinking.\u000aI've been here in Cairo for almost two months to the day which means, as much as I hate to say it, that I'm almost halfway done with my time here.  Realistically I know that the next two months and change will fly by faster than I can really know.\u000aSo what have I been missing from the states?  It varies a lot from day to day but the biggest one, of course, is friends and family.  I have gotten close with some of my roommates here in Cairo and it's such a comfort to be able to come home and talk to people who are experiencing the same things I am, but I really miss my friends from Olin and though I make healthy use of skype, it's of course not the same.\u000aI also miss my professors at Olin.  Decamping to another school for a semester has really taught me how lucky and spoiled I have been to have access to the kind of quality teaching that the professors at Olin provide.\u000aWhat I miss the most frequently here is a broad variety of good ethnic foods.  There's no chance of getting Ethiopian food here and the tofu pad thai, while recognizable as such, just isn't quite enough to ever satisfy my craving.  The restaurant scene here is pretty dominated by Middle Eastern food.  I really miss Mexican food.  I'd even be grateful for one lousy Anna's burrito. Apparently there is a decent mexican place in Cairo (yes that is one mexican restaurant worth mentioning in the entire city), but it's way out in the suburbs and pricey :(.  I will miss the local specialties of tamiyya (a variation on falafel) and koshari (macaroni, lentils, fried onions, chick peas, and sauce all mixed together, it's way more delicious than it sounds).\u000aAt the moment I really miss my laundry basket.  Our apartment floor has washers and dryers but I hate making the dash from laundry room into my room with my arms overflowing with clothes and underwear terrified that a bra will slip from the pile and scandalize our Egyptian guards.\u000aDid I mention that the American University in Cairo places guards on our floor (I'm in a university apartment) who make sure we're secure 24-7?  They're absolutely wonderful men and really look out for us, but they are Egyptian so we try not to walk through the halls in pajamas or revealing clothes as you might the dorms at Olin.  They're really sweet and I'll miss them when I go back to Olin, but it's also nice to be able to toss my laundry in the dryer or visit a friend down the hall in pjs or shorts.\u000aWhat I'll miss coming back to Olin?\u000aA big one is living in a city.  I'll really miss being able to hop in a taxi and go somewhere, not worrying that everything will be closed after 8pm (as it sometimes feels in Needham), and being able to walk to everything I'd need in terms of groceries, class, or most other things.\u000aI know I'll miss cooking for myself.  I know that with my schedule at Olin it's just not practical but with the food prices here and the lighter workload I've really grown to enjoy cooking for myself everyday and shopping for groceries.  I think I generally eat healthier than I would at Olin and it's relaxing.  Tagging along with the lighter schedule here is the extra time I've been able to spend traveling, relaxing and going to the gym.  The hectic pace of life at Olin can really get in the way of focusing on taking care of myself.\u000aI'll also miss the weather here.  I really played it smart missing spring semester at Olin when I get so sick of it being gray and cold for day after day and the winter seems like it'll never end.  The weather here so far has been absolutely gorgeous, day after day of blue sky, mild breezes, and warm weather.  However, I might change my mind about how great the weather is once it really starts heating up.  We're supposed to break 90 in the next couple days.  Fortunately it's dry heat so I don't feel it as much.\u000aI'll also miss some of the cultural aspects of living here.  You develop different kinds of relationships with people here, like I have a regular green grocer that I go to for my fruits and veggies and the Tammiya (falafel) guy across the street knows my face and can expect what I'll order.  This happens at Olin too, we all make friends with Rosemary and Stefania in the dining hall as well as the other staff, but it's nice to have it happen outside a small community like olin.  It also gives me plenty excuses to practice my Arabic which is, of course, improving much faster here than it ever did in Boston.\u000aHowever, the downside to the friendly culture here is that sometimes people get too friendly and in not such a nice way.  As  a foreign woman in Egypt I get harassed regularly on the street, mostly just small verbal things but it can really change how you feel about Egypt and Egyptians, particularly the men.  I've heard several different theories, but I still don't understand why some people here are so intent on getting my attention or why they do the things they do.  For example we had lots and lots of children say hi to us today at the Citadel and ask us what our names were.  It was cute and harmless though it did slow us down a bit.  However, when my roommate had her crotch grabbed (we say "grabbed" but in Cairo that usually means what by American standards would be considered a pat) by a teenage guy  it really becomes invasive and offensive.  Fortunately these incidents are not very common.  Personally I've only had one or two people touch me here; however, it is definitely something that has really changed my behavior in Egypt with respect with men.   Needless to say I won't miss it at all.\u000aAnyway, that's a story for another entry, but to end on a lighter note here are pictures from all the fun touristy things I've been doing.\u000aInside the tomb of a butcher to the royal household in Saqqara.\u000a\u000aThe Step Pyramid (the oldest pyramid) and assorted ruins.\u000a\u000aMohammed Ali Mosque in the Citadel in Cairo.\u000a\u000aThe white desert.  This rock formation is called the chicken and the tree.\u000aAnd of course, the obligatory camel ride to the pyramids in Giza\u000a\u000aHope you're having just as much fun as I am :)\u000a-Ana\u000a

aV\u000aIn my first days back at Olin after a full year's estrangement, I've been swept up in many, contradictory, feelings. At once, everything around campus is so familiar, and so changed - more than enough time has passed for a slew of curricular reforms to rise and fall.I've found scheduling my weeks to be both straightforward and overwhelming. The relief of knowing where I'll be sleeping by day's end is tempered by the stress that I may not actually get to sleep until the wee hours of the morning. My disorientation has been more pronounced in these first few weeks, when two years of old faces (the current seniors and juniors) and two years of new ones mix in a crowd of memories and confusion and opportunities. And yet, surrounded by these contradictions, I feel that I have, once again, made it home.\u000a\u000aRounding the corner to Great Plain Avenue for the first time in many months, I couldn't wipe the smile off my face. The parking lot was unchanged. The O was just as I had left it. But suddenly, I was an east hall resident, and was dragging my bins out of an unfamiliar storage room, over to a suite I'd never seen before, where I found my name next to five others' and a lounge, a full-sized fridge, a massive shower, and a bedroom all to myself! When I visited friends on staff up in their third floor offices, I found that, like in some labyrinth of lore, rooms had been shifted while I wasn't watching. New doors were open to me, and old ones closed. It's not quite the shock of returning to one's kindergarten or childhood home, but the thrill of rediscovery still resonates. I'm going to enjoy undertaking expeditions into once-familiar territories, and revisiting the memories I made there so long ago.\u000aAnd, in keeping with the traditions of innovation and openness to change around here, there are lots of exciting new courses being offered, and many old staples have been modified to be virtually unrecognizable! I'm excited to be taking the first structured course on Representing Olin, and the second offering of Teaching and Learning, along with POE - this time, with arduinos - and Mechanical Prototyping. Again, it's a mix of new, old, and changed, and it can't come quickly enough!\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, I've slipped back into using Outlook to plan my weeks like it's comfy slippers. Knowing what I'll be doing on a given day, a week or more in advance soothes my soul. Instead of scheduling my activity around a train's departure (and leaving ample time beforehand to sit and stare on a bench in the station), I can slot my events neatly into one another, taking advantage of Olin's tiny campus and lenient tardy trends to arrive precisely two minutes late to everything.\u000a\u000aI have so much time to do all the things I want to, now that I don't need to cook my own meals, worry about where I'll spend my next nights, or how I'll get there, pack and unpack my backpack morning, noon, and night, or run around a city like a chicken with my head cut off, just to print a document or, worse, fax one. Now, my days are mine to spend as I wish. Accordingly, I've taken onresponsibilitieswith SAC (the student activities committee) andcommitments forCORe (our student government, which is currently seeking a better Backronym), and am trying to spend as much time as I can with my classmates of 2013 before they graduate.\u000a\u000aLife is good on campus. My year of absence was a series of extraordinary and unique experiences abroad, all of which I am so lucky to have had. But after a year of non-stop on-the-go, let me tell you this: It's good to be home.\u000a

aV\u000aIn my Software Design class, the second half of the semester is devoted to a team project (I briefly mentioned it in my last post). Olin emphasizes incremental development; the idea is to always have a working program, rather than building out separate pieces and planning on tying them together at the end (you can read more about it in Professor Allen Downey's textbook). With about a month left to finish, my team recently completed our first working prototype (of any usefulness).So what is Pricecod? Our objective is to have an easily accessible way to quickly tell if an item a user sees in a store would be cheaper to buy online. Mobile applications - both native and web apps - are intriguing (and the hot area to work in) but we're frustrated that most commercial applications require an expensive smart phone and/or a data plan. As such, we're aiming to achieve our objective by building an application that, when users send a picture of a barcode from their cell phones, will text message them back with the cheapest prices and locations of that item online. (We know this app already exists - we're doing it to learn, jeez) If users don't have a camera on their cell phone, they could also send us the barcode number. \u000aWe don't exactly have all this working yet. We do have a start though: if you email fish@pricecod.com with a barcode number in the subject line, the Pricecod fish will (probably) email you back. No promises on the quality of the e-mail; it's a work in progress. There's a lot of pieces to tie together for our ideal app to work - we've been busy learning about OCR, SMS & SMTP protocol, and APIs for shopping sites like Amazon and Google Products. In the meantime, I'd really appreciate if you want to be one of Pricecod's first beta testers.  Just email fish@pricecod.com (there's a barcode somewhere near you, I know it. Check the bottom of your kleenex box) and then let me know what you think. Thanks! -Maia Bittner\u000a

aV\u000aHi there!\u000a My name is Xiaozheng Judy Xu and I'm a new freshman blogger! I can't believe I'm half way through my first semester at Olin already. Not long before this I was looking at this blog and getting fascinated and excited by what Oliners do. Now, sitting in my comfortable chair, submerged in the sunshine through my dorm's window, I look like this seal below:\u000a\u000a I saw him during Orientation at the Boston Aquarium when we had a Boston Scavenger hunt ;). We also saw the beautiful Boston Public Library and just missed Mike's Pastry which provided delicious canollis. Orientation passed by in a whiz, ending in the glory of our team pie-ing (throwing pies on to the face of) the R2 (Resident Resource)s, because we won the egg-drop competition!\u000a\u000a The campfire above was lit when I went camping with the Olin Outing Club at Mt. Madison/Mt.Washington, a three-hour drive away. Despite the rain, s'mores on a campfire and sleeping in a huge tent with 10 other freshman was awesome!\u000a\u000a\u000a The next day we climbed Mt. Madison and I ate this delicious sandwich on the summit. Going down was much harder, but we made it and I consider it a grand accomplishment! I strongly recommend going on the camping trip, and first years have priority!\u000a\u000a Oursibbfamily went on aVermonsterice cream dive at Ben's and Jerry's for our first family event. Every freshman gets an oldersibbwho answers all our questions and hang out with us. (p.s, Mysibb, Haley, is also a blogger!) 7 young men and women finished this whole bucket of 20 scoops of ice-cream, all together.\u000a\u000a One cool club I joined this semester, thanks to Pass-No-Record, is Glass club! Above are the glass fusions and beads I made. I've never done anything like this before and it is very fun and satisfying to make art~. To make the beads we meltglassrod in flames and mold them together. The fusions are easier: we cut small pieces of glass and arrange them together and Jiaying or Micheal (the glass club heads) magically fuse them into one piece for us. :)\u000a\u000a My co-curricular this semester is makingAerogamiwith Brad, our electrical engineer professor. Despite the 8-10am Monday morning timing, foldingair planesis very relaxing and flying them super fun. They can turn, twirl, rotate and do all kinds of things.\u000a  Speaking of Brad, he is also the professor of my favorite class,Eyesim(or more usually 'ISIM'), which stands for Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation and Measurements. I got to build MANY circuits on a breadboard and magically see my pulse on the computer screen and 'become' alive. I had no experience with circuits before, but with the tutorial lecture+ lab session+ Ninja (course assistants- "Need Information Now? Just Ask") tutorials, it's very easy to learn and 'understand' stuff.\u000a Looking back, I have really done a lot of things besides what I mentioned, and there are so many cool things that other people do. I'm listening to discrete math (drawing two-coloured stars and playing raisin games), learning electrical and software for Olin Robotic Sailing, trying to make a Japanese-learning game, making 'healthy' and sometimes disastrous dessert as a passional pursuit, and composing all kinds of strange pieces for my music class 'Wired Ensemble' (one of the AHS - Arts, Humanities and Social Science - classes we have to take). For instance, today I performed a found percussion piece using my TI-83 as an 'instrument'.\u000a Lastly, I want to share two things that I gladly found out after coming to Olin:\u000aWe have a super casual Taekwondo club! (I thought I couldn't do it anymore at Olin). Our club instructor, a junior named Erika, teaches us how to make sound effects instead of ki-yep (battle cry) when we kick.\u000aThe weather is super nice here, with more than 80% of sunny days, warm temperature (compared to Toronto, where I went to high school), and VERY beautiful leaves of all colours (this, compared to Canada where coloured maple leaves is our pride, means a lot).\u000aCheers, and to all the prospies: Don't stress out on your college apps, just try your best! Start learning useful software (ex. solid works,matlab,labview, etc), programming and build things outside of schoolwork! And most importantly, enjoy life! ;)\u000aX.Z.J.X\u000a

aV\u000a        There really is something to be said for Olin's small size and the sense of community it encourages. I know I've said this before, but it becomes increasingly apparent to me as the calendar pages turn. I can say that I know a good portion of my class -- honest-to-goodness know them. Countless hours of sleep have been shoved to the curb because I lose track of time just talking with people. They all have stories to tell, thoughts to share (or sell, depending on the person), and the stupidest jokes I have ever heard (Two fish are in a tank. One looks to the other and says, "How do we drive this thing?" or something along the lines of, "Your mom! Your face! Your mom's face!"). I can wander out of my room at any given time and find somebody with whom I can go explore, build a coilgun, eat cereal, wrestle, or just shoot the breeze. But they can also wander up (or down) to my room.\u000a        Over the past few months, I have come to know these visitors so well that I can pick them out by their knocks. I hear a "knock, knock" and don't feel compelled to ask "Who's there?" Yes, indeed, everybody has a distinct style. For example:\u000aTim knocks softly, distractedly. We have to scream at him to come in, because he rarely hears the first time.\u000aTara raps sharply, with little hands, and opens the door immediately upon -- but not an instant before -- hearing a welcome. She will wait patiently, never knocking a second time.\u000aJon's knock is lethargic, almost filled with dread. He usually comes by when it's time to do calculus or physics problem sets.\u000aLiz is more of a newcomer to our room, but I would characterize her knock as "quintessential." It's a classic three- to four-beat tap.\u000aLuke and Nathaniel may pound on the door once or twice, and we hear panicked footsteps or indiscriminate scuffling just after. They're often searching for a hiding place during a multi-floor pursuit.\u000aMichael pretends he hears us say "come in" and just walks right through the threshold. The knock and the turning of the door handle are simultaneous.\u000a\u000aThe incredible thing is that I look forward to each of these knocks, these promises of fun (or problem sets). Surprisingly (at least surprisingly to me), there are all sorts of personalities floating around here. It's important to get to know them, the people with whom I live and work. Admittedly, things can get tense in such a small space, but coming from a small school and relatively small town, the adjustment to the size was not too difficult. I welcomed the tight-knit, close-quarters feel.\u000aOf course, this is not ideal for everybody, and even I sometimes need to get away, out of the "Olin Bubble". Fortunately, this is fairly easy to do (I'll probably write more about this later). A short trip into Boston, an errand in Needham, even a walk in Parcel B usually provides enough space to take a breath and to clear an Oliner's head. All in all, on a day-to-day basis, I'm happy to hear the knock at the door, whether it's a quick tap, a barely audible blow, or a steady pounding. No matter who it is, I know that they understand my frustration with ModCon. They understand that I am likely running on four hours of sleep. They understand my excitement upon receiving a package from home. There is a strong thread running through all of them; a common facet is carved into every member of the community. Yet, they all have a unique contribution, their own knock at the door.\u000a

aV\u000a        Howdy folks! I'm a new face around these parts. My name is William, and you might have guessed, at least, based on the '16 after my name, that I'm a freshman. Well, your guess would be right on the money. I've been on campus now since Saturday the 25th of August, and classes got underway on the 30th, so we've been on campus for a little over two weeks. I say we, of course, referring to the other members of the class of 2016.\u000a\u000a\u000aThis was taken during orientation, with the R2s in the background on the stairs and the class of 2016 out front! We're a pretty awesome bunch, but you can read more about that other places. That's not nearly as interesting as what we've been up to lately. These past two weeks have been some of the most exciting, and I know it's just going to get more awesome from here.\u000a        I've done so much already. I've learned a new programming language, I've foraged in the fields for insects, I've wired circuits... many times. Even after they fail to work and short every component. I've order midnight pizza. I've joined the Olin Player's Club as a techie, and my roommate got the lead roll in Dr. Horrible (Don't know what it is? Check it outhereand come back after you have.) I've met pretty much the entire school, an awesome feat, even if you take into account that there's under 300 students all in. However, there is something more awesome then all of this.\u000a\u000aAll the people I've met are some of the smartest, most talented, and, quite frankly, mostawesomepeople that I could have ever met. For me, one of the biggest worries about Olin was it's size, but I definitely haven't been feeling too cramped because of the people around me are so engaging and interesting. When I was looking at other schools throughout the application process, one of the biggest questions I'd ask myself was "Can I find a place where I'd be at home?" In the larger schools, that would be easy, statistically speaking if you're one in a million there are around seven thousand people just like you. When you get smaller, you risk making the pool of people you could possibly connect to and become very good friends with very small. Not so with Olin. Even if this school is smaller then most people's high schools, the culture it creates and the people it attracts means that after day one everyone is someone you can talk to without fear of stepping over some unspokenboundary.\u000a\u000aThat type of culture is what defines Olin, and sets it apart from possibly every other school in the nation. Of course, everything else does a pretty good job of that too. I joked with a friend that Olin is like being hoisted up on a crane and dropped five stories into a pool of water. It's scary at first, but soon enough you're doing flips and landing gracefully, and when they ask to drop you six, you shrug and say, "Why not ten?".\u000a\u000aIt may have only been two weeks. But it's already home. If you're on campus, come visit me! I'd love to talk with you. You might catch me giving tours, or doing other things around on campus. Ask me why this place is awesome, and why you should come. But for now, I've got some labs to finish.\u000a\u000a-W\u000a

aV\u000a        It's Spring Break at Olin, and although I find myself staying in a decidedly non-Spring-like Boston (snow flurries today), I am lucky enough to travel vicariously to warmer, more colorful places: namely India, Ghana, and Greensboro, Alabama. This Spring Break, Olin's new program in "Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship" is taking teams of Olin and Babson students to these three locations to address the well-being of low-income communities through collaborative design of innovative technology-ventures.\u000a\u000a(Follow the trips on our blog: http://adetravelblog.blogspot.com)\u000a\u000aIt was almost exactly a year ago when Professor Benjamin Linder sent a draft course description to Ollie Haas ('11) and me, asking for feedback. I remember sitting in my apartment in New Zealand, where I was studying away, feeling my excitement rise and rise as I read the proposal: an international, multi-campus course open to engineering and business undergrads... seeking to alleviate poverty through the creation of innovative, affordable technologies and the business ventures that make those viable... directly engaging with low-income and resource-poor communities in the U.S. and abroad over the 1-2 years it will take to implement these ventures... aiming to offer the first course in Spring 2011 with 20 Olin and Babson students...\u000aOllie and I replied within hours of receiving the email:This sounds totally unreasonable and incredibly exciting. How can we be involved?!!Our discussions throughout the summer resulted in the three of us (Ben, Ollie, and me) traveling to Alabama and Morocco last fall, with Ben somehow managing to also squeeze in trips to India and Ghana as his year on sabbatical rushed to a close. Through these visits, we built community and university partnerships and made plans for engaging with them the following semester. We had long conversations over fried catfish in Alabama and between sips of sweet minty-green tea in Morocco, exploring all manner of philosophical and logistical questions pertinent to the formation of such a program. And with the support of Babson Professor Erik Noyes, visiting Olin research scientist Mihir Ravel, and many other key people at Olin and Babson, all the pieces came together in time for the first offering this spring.\u000a\u000aThe entire experience of developing and now taking Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship (ADE) has been one of the most impactful of my Olin career: working with amazing people at Olin and around the world passionate about affecting positive change, contributing to all levels of developing an international program, and seeing a dream become a reality with the support of the Olin community.\u000a\u000aApart from keeping in touch with the ADE teams from afar, my own Spring Break will be spent working on a few independent projects, attending StartingBloc in Boston, and getting my mind around the fact that I will be graduating in a few short months' time!\u000a

aV\u000a        I know you all want to see picturesof the dorm rooms, so let's jump right in.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThose lovely nighttime photos came from Brittany, whose blog posts you have probably read. They illustrate some of the basics of the Olin dorm rooms. In the dorms you will find:\u000aa bed (Twin XL),\u000aa spacious desk with drawers,\u000aa good desk chair,\u000aa wardrobe (seen in the corner of the room in the second photo),\u000aa dresser with 3 large drawers (seen peeking out from underneath the beds in the photos above, but you are welcome to move it out and around the room),\u000aand some shelves (you sort of see them in the second photo, to the right of the dresser, under the bed).\u000a\u000aThere is two of everything because first years live in doubles. You will have extra floor space for more shelves, floor lamps, or extra seating, all of which Brittany has, and can be seen in the above photos.\u000a\u000aDuring the night, the lighting is poor, so you will probably end up buying / making more lighting for your room one way or another. During the day, the windows are excellent.There are some photos of the dorms during the day on Flickr, but they are of a single, not a double (so the room is a bit smaller, and only has enough furniture for one person). You incoming students (assuming you are the ones reading this) are all going to be living in doubles like the one pictured above.\u000a\u000aI hope you found this helpful. Let me know if you want to see more photos, and I'll get them online promptly. When I was applying to colleges, I remember not being able to find photos of the Olin dorms. That was frustrating. I want to make sure all the future Olin applicants and incoming students have access to more information than I did. Remember, if you have any questions about the Olin dorms or want to see more photos, contact me and I'll gladly talk with you personally or post some more on the blog. Enjoy!\u000a-Cypress\u000a

aV\u000aTrapped inside the Olin Bubble, and only superficially aware of how other schools actually operate, it's been hard for me to judge what we've actually accomplished in terms of fine-tuning the college process. And I'm not talking about our curriculum, which outsiders comment on fairly regularly-- in light of studying economics, living the social life of a metropolis, and exploring the culture of Europe, I feel that I've gained new perspective on the little things that make Olin flow.\u000aTake R2s. At Olin, we have a trained (and compensated) group of students who are available to lead the transition into college, be available for you, and help you get that door unlocked at 1 am. Even though six full-time adult staff members live in my 500 person dorm complex here at UCL, I've been advised to not disturb them after 11pm unless it's an extreme emergency. IE, if you're locked out of your room, sleep in the hall. I have much renewed value for my Olin R2s after living in this dorm at UCL. They are students that I trust, feel comfortable approaching, and lastly are often awake at the odd hours Oliners are awake. \u000aFacilities at Olin are nice; they're still new. But you don't miss your staffed mailbox until you dig through a 3 month pile of mail of everyone whose last name starts with D. Or you don't realise how much Olin's 1 laundry machine for every 25 people sure beats 1 for every 100. Or having wireless internet, though often flaky, not only in academic rooms, but in your own bedroom, and with no limit to how many computers you may connect to the network.  Or the safety of sprinklers, which are conspicuously absent in my 4 year old dorm building at UCL. Fire alarms however, are not absent, as I've rudely found out many times during the night.\u000aEach of these examples is an investment in student living. Certainly, there's no real need for most of them. We have adults living in each dorm already, we have wired connections in our rooms, and wouldn't 3 laundry machines really be enough? As Oliner's get older, we often get jaded, and take for granted what we have, and defensive of what we need to let go. UCL is an incredible place, but has chosen to distribute its resources differently. Their choices have taught me a new perspective on Olin. \u000a*And while I've illuminated many things at Olin that are good, there are many things UCL does better, for one reason or another. That's another blog post though. \u000a

aV\u000a-- by Mike Hughes, Class of 2010Last week, the students, faculty, and staff of Olin engaged in what I think is our greatest community tradition: the annual fundraising auction hosted by SERV, our campus service organization dedicated to Support, Encourage, and Recognize Volunteerism.\u000a Every year, SERV seeks donations from all members of the Olin community. This year we had almost 300 submissions and raised $9591! The bidding wars brewed all week during silent auction and came to a head at the live auction for big ticket items during lunch last Friday.\u000a\u000a\u000aHere's a clip of the live auction where students fight over the heavily contested pair of tickets to a Red Sox - Yankees game next spring at Fenway Park. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI hosted the auction this year alongside my friend (and fellow blogger) George Sass. Bidding wars were fierce and I loved watching faculty, staff, and students compete to win top prizes like a shopping trip guided by Dr. Jessica Townsend (Mechanical Engineering). \u000aMore photos and comments after the jump. \u000a        A highly sought after prize at the live auction was MANual Labor donated by my hallway of 20 guys. We promised 50 man-hours of labor and stood proudly in front of the crowd as professors and staff competed for our strength. We eventually sold for $500.\u000aSilent Auction items also saw heavy bidding wars during the final seconds. I'm always amazed at how many Olin students get so enthusiastic about the auction.\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVOn behalf of the Class of 2009, welcome to the fourth commencement of Olin College! It is fantastic to see us all gathered here, everyone who contributed to the successful Olin career of the Class of 2009. I think it is not just the students who will agree that life at Olin is something of a whirlwind. In our day to day frenzy of building, thinking, learning, and growing, it is hard to picture coming out of it. It is not hard to have ideas about what to do next: Those ideas are startlingly plentiful. But rather, it is hard to imagine Olin being over. It is tough to fathom what it will truly feel like to be done, and to have left Olin College. It wasn't until very recently that I even considered the notion of Olin being a past tense activity. It took a certain trigger to make it happen. What triggered the idea that finishing Olin was real was this class ring. 
p1834
aVHere is a tangible, constant embodiment of Seniority. The class ring is a badge of honor, sparkling with the grim determination of many all-nighters. Its engraved band connects exploration to confusion to enlightenment, four years thick. This annular herald of graduation is a sign that you have finished, you have achieved the task set for yourself by coming to Olin. The ring represents a monumental doing. And when I first slid it on my finger, I had not thought of my action-packed life here at Olin as something that could be so quaintly summarized in shiny titanium, and placed neatly on my hand. 
p1835
aVYet here it is, finished: 4 years of smelting, forming, milling, and polishing, and suddenly the ring exists, my Olin life exists, as a concise and complete thing. The making and the living are in the past. Now the things I have been so focused on doing are just a part of the whole of me. These four years of transforming experience will soon be four of many, and instead of living and breathing Olin, I will be referring to it, remembering it, and drawing on it as a resource for the future. It will now be a means to other ends. As totally as I was immersed in the making, the finishing leaves me free. I move on adorned only by a tiny symbol of a huge endeavor. 
p1836
aVThe ring's power as a symbol certainly has limits. It certainly cannot express everything that went into earning it. The real result of Olin is me standing before you, it is this outstanding Class of 2009 about to Commence its post-Olin reality. I sometimes dream of days in the future when I will meet Olin alumni on the bus, and recognize them by their silver-blue ring. Then I realize how foolish this is when I know the first 7 classes of Olin graduates and can probably recognize them much more directly. But there is power in the accomplishment we have shared, we graduates. 
p1837
aVBeing at Olin binds us together in a way that few things do. The experience we have shared here is unique and intense. We came to a school asking not only that we excel in classes, but also that we critique and recreate them as we go. This is no small task: it is a special challenge with special reward to take a course that has never been offered before. What's more, we have never had the hollow simplicity of ignoring the broader context of our work. Also not an easy prospect. And we have seen that the problems worth solving are complex, they need multiple perspectives to understand, and you probably don't have all the information you need when you begin. We have tackled these challenges and persevered: Bravo to us for making it through. 
p1838
aVThe Class of 2009 remembers the days when we barely knew where ICB Calculus stopped and Physics began. We were here when UOCD Design Reviews meant 30 Domino's pizza boxes in the hallway of the AC at 2 am. We were here before our degrees were accredited, when belief in Olin was internal motivation without so much external approval. This was never about prestige for us. 
p1839
aVWe came here for the risk and the thrill, knowing that the risk was inherent to a deed worth doing. I deeply hope that Olin stays risky. I hope that the people here keep pushing past what others think is possible or comfortable. For a school of 300 in a world of 7 billion, to stay risky is the only way to stay relevant. 
p1840
aVNow, when I look out from the O and think on the uncertainty and risk in the world today, part of me says, "Perfect." Who better to adapt to newness than us? The world is changing. I think we have been learning to evolve quickly for years now, and the Class of 2009 has gotten good at it. But we are no passive adapters, we graduates. Openness to change is not enough; instigating change is even more critical. I believe in this class, I believe that we will take the risk to drive hard for great changes. 
p1841
aVTo conclude I want to say thank you to the Class of 2009. You set the bar high with your excellence, but you picked it up when any of us knocked it down. I am still blown away by your talents, your tenacity, and your compassion. This is a rare and powerful group of people and I am honored to be a part of it.
p1842
aVAnd thank you Olin, with all your supportive and demanding people, for pushing our class past comfort and into greatness. Even if we lose our symbols of graduation and drop our class rings down the drain, we will still have this shared achievement of completing Olin in 2009. May all of you stay risky, and go far. Good luck, everyone.

aV\u000aIts been a while since I last posted on the blog, and a lot has changed in my life, as well as around me. Now, I come back to the Olinsider as a senior, old and wise, and ready to impart the wisdom of the ancients onto you. Its in that vein that I started to reflect and think back on three years at Olin with one to go, and consider why I have felt such a strong affinity to this place above all else.\u000aSee, in the quest to be an engineer, you have to learn how to, well, learn. Thats the sort of thing that I love about engineering. The challenges that we face dont have easy answers, or sometimes even answers at all. In that strange way engineering to me is more like an art than a science. We are the renegades that search for answers in an uncertain world. We use the scientific formulas, knowledge, and background as paint and brushes, but our art is in the synthesizing of those parts into a greater whole.\u000aTake the first year courses (which are so long ago, ah!) Courses like Design Nature and Modeling and Simulation ask of you to create works of art; they want you to solve problems like How do populations of sea turtles shift as temperatures rise and fall? or How can you make your contraption of delrin and cloth flap its wings like a bird does?. And in the process of those classes they give you the various colors, pens, and various art analogies in explanations about physics and fabrication, in mathematical modeling, and computer aided design just to name a few. What makes this different is that people can spend their four years learning as much as there is to know about physics, math, or design, but that, to me, feels like making a whole lot of paint and doing nothing with it. The beauty of engineering is to learn the right amount of everything so you can do anything.\u000aIn a more recent example, take Computer Networks, a special topics course. It combines networking theory and computer programming with a splash of morse code, history, and data analysis to create a class thats all about building a network from the ground up. Olins best classes are like this, instead of focusing on deep subject area expertise (which is important, still, dont get me wrong), focusing on broader knowledge and then putting it into practice. The expectation is not that you exit the class knowing everything, but rather, that you exit the class having built something, and know how to further your knowledge in the field. Its different from classes where you are given the information that you have to know. Instead, you are given what you have to know and told to find the information.\u000aIts scary to be a renegade, and Ill admit that. To be presented with the solution and not the problem is so counter to my, and Im sure to many other peoples traditional views of how education should work. But engineers in the real world are presented with the solutions that are wanted and are asked the question How? And thats the most exciting thing that I had here at Olin. Ive been able to immerse myself in the How as opposed to lecture and theory, and looking back on it I cant imagine going to any other school anywhere else.\u000a

aV\u000aThat's right, it's halfway through the semester and it's time for me to take some midterms. And time for you to get a class update from me.\u000aI've gone to 70 hours of class so far this semester:\u000a... and I have 7.5 hours of midterms.\u000aI had my first Neuroscience test last week. To be honest, it did not go very well. There were 40 multiple choice questions and 4 essay questions. One of the essay questions was:\u000a\u000aYour wacky professor says that "your sensory systems are not there to report exactly what the stimuli out there really are; they're there to interpret them." What does this mean? Explain using at least 2 different research findings (hint: some of the illusions that we discussed work well for this purpose).\u000a\u000a        After reading that question, my thought process was something along the lines of "That's so cool! I love this class I can't believe that's an essay question that's like exactly what I'm all about and just 2 research findings? I could name 10! There's the rats that feel less pain with their moms and how we always look for faces in things and the kittens with the goggles and jeez this is what I talk to my friends about all the time. And illusions! I can't believe how great this class is it's like explaining every optical illusion I've ever been emailed..." and so on, slouched back in my chair, staring at the wall and glorifying cognitive science for about 15-20 minutes. At which point, I realized I had about 20 minutes left. To write 4 essays.  \u000aI decided to start with the other essays, since they'd be harder as I was less excited about them.  I rushed through them, and had a couple minutes to write the last essay, which might as well have asked me "Hey Maia, why are you excited about taking this class?" I managed to quickly scratch out seven whole sentences before it was time to turn in the test. Yes, a seven sentence essay. It wasn't too bad - I ended up getting a 7/10 on that question (perhaps one point per sentence?), but I'm still pretty disappointed.\u000aIn other news, yesterday was my Linguistics midterm, which was... a nice ego-booster.  (Even more so if I forget it's an intro freshman class).\u000aSoftware Design, my sole Olin class, does not have any tests, but we are now switching from individual homework assignments to starting our half-semester long group project. My group's project is super cool. It's a web app that involves text messaging, python, OCR, Google App Engine, APIs and other fun acronyms. Stay tuned for updates.\u000aFinally, my Consumer Behavior midterm is not until next week, so I haven't started studying yet. Wish me luck!\u000a

aV\u000aFirst, my apologies to the other bloggers for blogging twice in a row. However, it has been one week, and the Jessi Murray's constant admonishments for not blogging continue to haunt my most frightening dreams.\u000aNow, onto my summer plans:\u000a1) Pass Classes, leave Olin: Alright so I'm not sure about that first part. Grades aren't posted until Friday. However, the really strange part is that I just don't care. In high school I was really really obsessive about my grades. I would constantly check them to ensure that I was on track for an A or A+. Now it is more "Meh." I know that I put in as much effort as I could towards my classes, and I trust my professors to award me appropriately. I did not really go above and beyond, as my passions and excitements are in student government, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a B average. That would have killed my in high school. Now I'm exuberant. As for leaving Olin, well, that was rougher than I had expected. First, packing sucks. To all incoming freshmen: BRING FEW THINGS and buy less. You'll just have to pack them later, and that's hard. Graduation was inspiring (I teared up a few times), but I'll let someone else cover that. Finally it was time to leave Boston. 3 canceled flights and 24 hours past my expected arrival time, I arrived in Dallas. Oh yea, that's a funny story. No really, I was laughing all the way through the 2 2-hour-long rescheduling lines. Ask me about it some time. Haha. *GLARE*\u000a2) Go to Texas, Pass Go, Collect a new vehicle: Right, so current I am in Dallas, TX visiting my dad and working on my new Jeep with him. It rocks so hard. "It" meaning both the Jeep and the working. My dad's a car guy, and I've not been, so he's teaching me a lot. So many things I needed to know. It's actually a lot of fun. And Jeeps are super cool, very customizable. See previous post for a picture. I'm having a blast. But alas, I am also taking up too much of the front page. Please click below to read more:\u000a3) Drive, Baby, Drive: So after we get the Jeep tuned up, I'll be heading north to Erie, PA to visit my grandparents there. That's two very long says of driving. Wish me luck. Traditionally, Oliners taking road trips can ask who lives along their route to get free room and board for various nights. I really should have done it, but didn't get around to that in time. Plus, sleezy motels are part of the fun, too. There are quite a lot of Olin people across the country, so if I'm ever in a bind, I know there will be someone to call.\u000a4) Visit grandparents: Fairly self-explanatory.\u000a5) Drive to Boston: Again, not much to it. Long day of driving. I-90 all the way. That's right, I-90, not "The 90" as Californians would call it. For all the Californians reading this (like Nikki) just know that you're weird. ANYWAY, yep, I-90 all the way. Fun fact: Seattle and Boston are the beginning and end of I-90, meaning I've been to both, and it's really just one road all the way from my house to school. I still haven't come up with a catchy nickname to express that.\u000a6) Do a super-cool internship: Alright, this is the real reason I wrote this entry, to talk about my internship. I'll be working with Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates (www.vsea.com) this summer up in Gloucester, MA (that's pronounced Gla-ster or Gla-stah for Boston natives, not Glow-kester), which is 50 miles from Olin, where I'll be living, hence the road-tripping vehicle. I'm basically in the coolest post-Freshmen year internship every. They hired me to help them write a software emulator of the super-complex semiconductor fabricators they produce. I have to understand how these things work so that I can write each of their individual parts as things that interact with each other. I am so very excited. Here's the downside: I don't know C++. Mind you, I can think like a programmer, and understand object-orientation just fine. But my programming vocabulary is similar that that of a one-year old's. I've got little more than Matlab. I explained this to my employer, and they're cool with it. They trust me to learn quickly. I firmly believe that I sold myself on my school's reputation more than my own. Really, though I have a very strong resume, I'm not well suited for the position. I think that the idea of an Olin engineer convinced my employer that I could do anything. Yea, I'm okay with that.\u000a7) Interact with the other quarter or so of Olin that's in the Boston area: I'm looking forward to it. Like I've said before, Olin has super cool people, but it's hard to find time to just hang-out. I expect this summer to rock. Last year, they inflated water craft and boated the Charles. Yea, I'm not just excited, I'm super excited. *Shudders of Excitement*\u000a8) Visit my family in Seattle for 2 weeks: I feel bad that this time is not longer. First, I decided to go to school 3,000 miles away from my mother and little sister. Then I decided to spend my summer at an internship said distance + 50 miles away. Both were opportunities too good to pass down, but it does hurt not to be able to see them as often. However, I will totally make the most out of those 2 weeks. Summary: Olin is worth living across the country, but I wouldn't call it easy.\u000a9) Return to Olin: I'm already looking forward to it. There's a facebook group called "I get Olin sick." Too true, too true.\u000aSince I really don't have pictures this week, I'll post something from www.icanhascheezburger.com, one of my new favorite websites to which I was recently introduced. It now owns my soul. Enjoy!\u000a\u000aAlways,\u000aJeff Moore\u000a

aV\u000aAlmost exactly two years ago I fell in love with Olin. Candidate's Weekend 2 of 2012 was probably one of the most exciting experiences of my life. My high school experience had made me grow used to a competitive, cutthroat atmosphere in which everyone wanted to be better than everyone else; students competed over test scores, rigorous classes, and research projects. I didn't really know much about Olin, but I thought that I needed to take it upon myself to represent the atmosphere my high school gave off and be competitive. Of course, I was on a team with a student from my school's "rival" school, which only increased my anxiety and view that I had to be competitive.\u000a Suddenly, I was thrown into a situation where grades, test scores, and classes didn't matter. Olin students were running around in crazy hats and sunglasses, and my design team seemed just as excited to be a part of Olin as the current students were. There was no point in being cynical, competitive, or serious. During the first hour of Candidates Weekend, from both the excitement of Oliners and Candidates, I realized that my entire high school experience had been based upon a competitive atmosphere. Olin introduced me to what I feel is the most important part of learning, which is not in the material itself, but in the experience. Even though our contraption exploded when the slightest breeze touched it (which I admit was part of the challenge), building some crazy contraption with people that I had never met before was one of the most fun experiences I had ever had.\u000aOur slighty awkward Candidate's Weekend group photo from 2012!\u000aI realized that I wanted to be in a place surrounded with people who were learning for the sake of learning, and not for the sake of grades, test scores, or colleges. I wanted friends that loved to have fun with things that they learned, and after a few short minutes talking to Olin faculty members, students, and parents, I realized that Olin was exactly the place where these types of people could be found. The friends that I have made here at Olin are people who can get inspired by everyday objects; they can pick up a roll of duct tape, some wood, an Arduino, and some servo motors, and can end up with some crazy robot in a matter of hours, just for fun.\u000aA slightly awkward impression of our slightly awkwardCandidate's Weekend group photo from 2012 in 2013 (Four out of the five of us attened Olin).\u000aOlin has completely changed the way that I look at learning, it has helped me develop my passions, and it has shaped me into a person I didn't expect to become. Candidate's Weekend revealed a whole new world to me, and I hope that it has the same effect on all of you Candidates going through the process right now. The most important piece of advice I can give you is that you shouldn't try to be someone you aren't. Remember to be yourself, because you are awesome.\u000a

aV\u000aAnd it seems so surreal. I'm interviewing again this year, as I did last year, and I'm pretty pumped. (Even if it makes me feel old...) Last year, three of my five interviewees ended up coming to Olin, and while I didn't meet any freshmen until this semester, it was fun to think that I at least knew three.\u000aI haven't gotten my assignment for who I'm interviewing, or who my fellow interviewers are yet. I do know that I am interviewing this weekend, and possibly next. So, what should you expect?\u000aDuring my first interview, when I was applying to Olin, I was quite intimidated by my later-physics prof. Zhenya. "Why would Vonnegut want to have dinner with you?" she asked me, more than terrifying with her steely Russian stare. Later, when she found out I got in, she told me how excited she was. She ended that with, "I am going to crush you with physics."\u000aNeedless to say, interviews can be scary.\u000aI like to think that I am not an intimidating person- short, smiling, and spectacled- but I know that sometimes there are nerves all over the place for your interview. Here are my two cents, having been on both sides of the process:\u000aBe yourself. Candidates Weekend is a time for you to find out how you and Olin fit together. You might be nervous, ready to puke even, but if you're yourself, we can see how you might work when you're not a bundle of crazy.\u000aOn a similar note: don't try to game the interview. If you try to incorporate how you overcame adversity into every question, it's just going to feel forced and awkward. This will not help you in the long run.\u000aAsk questions. There's a student interviewer on your panel for a reason. If you aren't going to be happy with Olin, it's better to know ahead of time. If you are going to be happy with Olin, you might as well get a sense of where you'll be for the next 4 years.\u000aHave fun! Candidaes Weekend has a lot more than the interview- see as much as you can, and enjoy it!\u000aGood luck, everyone, and see you soon!\u000a-jessi\u000a

aV\u000a        There are a lot of great things about being home. I get to see my family and friends (my brother is graduating from high school in a couple weeks!). Transportation is far more convenient. Frozen custard is once again a staple in my diet. But I'm also Olin-sick. It's hard not to be.\u000a        I assume this will get better as the years go on, but for now, I'm looking forward to the fall. Don't get me wrong; I plan to make this summer a fantastic one. It's just that Olin has really become a special place to me and there are some things I miss.\u000aThings I miss about Olin:\u000aFirst and foremost, people.\u000aProximity to the ocean.\u000aFriendly's.\u000aLongboarders.\u000aMy faulty drying rack.\u000aPeople.\u000aBabsonite-spotting.\u000aThe Charles River and abandoned train tracks.\u000aSleeping on a desk (every night for nearly an entire semester!).\u000aGO! bikes, however questionable their functionality may be.\u000aThe Olin dining hall staff.\u000aScary roads.\u000a"Wicked" awesome adventures.\u000aPeople.\u000aReady-made meals.\u000aOversized bean bag chairs.\u000aDuct tape (oh, wait...they don't have that at Olin...anywhere).\u000aSpur-of-the-moment skirmishes.\u000aSmelly, screeching subway trains,\u000aLast but not least, people.\u000aRight now, it's hard to imagine three months away from school.

Does the redundancy bother anybody, or is it passable?\u000a

aV\u000aHi all. Sorry for the radio silence these days - sometime, I'll explain the scheduling factors that made this fall an extremely technical and time-intensive "normal course load". \u000aBusyness aside, I'm taking the night off to watch that most American of contests, wherein commentators attempt to say the least with the flashiest graphics. Oh, and people get elected too. \u000aOlin's insulating effect ("the Olin Bubble") is sometimes cited for keeping Olin students rather separate from political events, but it doesn't seem to be in effect for this election. We've had informal pre-votes, rides organized to the Needham polling place, lots of anguish about the lack of stickers for absentee ballots, and I know off-hand of at least 5 lounges where the results are being watched live. In true Olin style, in EH1 lounge we have media on more devices than people.\u000aAll in all, I've been proud of the thoughtfulness and civility at Olin. Regardless of what happens, I'm pretty sure we'll all still be talking tomorrow - and at a 300 student school, that's awfully important!\u000a

aV\u000aHello and good day!  Welcome to my premier post and blog where I will share some of my thoughts and feelings about life and Olin.  If you're so inclined you may read about my everyday happenings, which I'll try to keep interesting even when my life isn't.  If you are not so inclined, please stop reading immediately, for I ensure you this post will be entirely about things that I think and do.\u000aIf you'd like to know some important facts about me please check out my bio.  But there are few things about me that are not in my bio and may be useful (or not useful as the case may be) to know about me.\u000a\u000aI'm rather fond of lists, and this format will probably be a reoccurring theme.\u000aI'm working at the Kamm Lab this summer at MIT doing research on differentiating neurons from mouse embryonic stem cells on a variety of materials in microfluidic devices.\u000aI'm living with my 43 and 14 year old second cousins (actually my second cousin and second cousin once removed if you're nitpicky about those kinds of things) for the first half of the summer, and Oliners in Sommerville for the second half.\u000aI saw Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince at its midnight release with a whole host of Oliners.  The drama!  The intrigue!  Flighty dark wizards, ink enveloped memories and budding romance!  Oh, the joys of my favorite teenage wizard!  All in all, an excellent film.\u000aI'm not a reliable source for movie reviews, as I tend to like them all.\u000aUnbelievably, it is already half way through the summer\u000a         and it looks like the weather has finally agreed to be agreeable, which means I'm biking to work.  However, I sometimes take the T, and I thought I would share some useful T etiquette, for those who were curious or planning on living in Bostonia.\u000a\u000aRules and Regulations for Riding the T\u000a\u000a\u000aAvoid eye contact at all costs.  If accidental eye contact occurs, smile, look apologetic then quickly look away.  Bringing some sort of electrical gadget or book makes this much easier, and pretending to text message even though you are clearly without signal is always a good choice.\u000aMake sure to sit in the odd seats so that you can avoid sitting directly next to a stranger for as long as possible.  The seats closest to the door are ideal, because even in the worst case scenario you will only be sitting next to one stranger.  Also, ignore the priority seating signs, it seems those are mere guidelines.\u000aAvoid sitting directly across from a group of friends if there are only a few people on the train.  I did this once, and felt like I was their own personal one-woman audience.\u000aGetting on the first or last car is more fun that riding in the middle cars.\u000aThe Kendall/MIT stop is the best, because there are multiple lever to pull which makes things go "bing."  (One lever actually does nothing, try to avoid that one.)\u000aStand with you feet perpendicular to the direction of the train, as there is more side to side movement, except, of course, when coming to a stop or beginning to move.\u000a\u000aFrom my favorite magazine, The New Yorker.  "New in Town" by Robert Leighton.\u000a\u000aIf traveling with friends, all previously mentioned suggestions should be ignored, because no one really cares anyways.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn the words of the great and forever loved wizard, Albus Dumbledore, "Pip pip!"\u000a\u000a--Tiama '11\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aLet me start off by introducing myself, since I am a guest writer here.  I'm Jeff Stanton, I'm in Olin's Class of 2010, I will be a Junior this fall,  and I am pursuing a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Olin.\u000aThis past year at Olin has been a great one, especially for me. I took many interesting courses, greatly increased my knowledge of ECE topics from software to hardware, improved significantly at billiards, continued my studies in music and entrepreneurship and fell in line with an awesome group of friends including students in the classes of 2009, 2010 and 2011. I visited Little Italy in Boston for no fewer than four birthday dinners, flew home to North Carolina for three separate graduations in my family and managed to coax myself and my friends away from our studies long enough to get off-campus and have tons of fun together.\u000a\u000aOlin students Leif, Dani, Thomas, myself and Jessica celebrate a birthday and the end of a great year by going out for dinner.\u000aThe last year has also been one in which I have come to see the strength of our small community and to understand how much people here care about each other. At the start of the 2007 fall semester, two Olin students passed away in a motorcycle wreck. Although I was not particularly close friends with either student, they were still Olin students and I was shaken up by their deaths. We all grew a bit closer that day and together we got past our grief and launched full-swing into the year.\u000aA bit over two weeks ago, Jessica - a member of the class of 2011 and a very close friend of mine - passed away following medical complications. I and some of her other friends knew early on, but the announcement did not hit Olin until a few days later. About 50 Olin students - myself included - are living on-campus this summer pursuing various jobs or research. The rest are scattered about the country and the world. Even before the announcement came out, I was torn apart by the passing of my best friend. At some points I sobbed until no more tears would come. People stopped by to check in on me, making sure I was all right - at the time, the announcement had not gone out, and out of respect for the family I couldn't tell everybody until the announcement was sent out. I remember hearing that the email was about to be sent Sunday night - 5 days after I heard - and I headed for the lounge. As I arrived, people who were already out in the lounge watching the Red Sox game were just looking up from their laptops after reading their email. The looks on their faces and the hugs we exchanged said so many things simultaneously: shock at the loss of a community member; sympathy for my loss of a close friend; an understanding of my pain the previous days;  a disbelief that a third member of our tight-knit community had died in  less than a year.\u000a\u000aOlin's flag flies at half-mast in memory of Jessica.\u000aI saw something incredibly special happen at Olin in the midst of my struggle to overcome my grief and come to acceptance. Many people came to my room, my suite or my lab to talk with me, listen to me or simply provide their company. Not only did my friends check in on me, but more poignantly I heard from alumni and stduents at Olin who I hardly spent any time with. I received emails, phone calls and Facebook messages from as far away as Germany and as close as Cambridge. My closer friends and I logged countless hours on the telephone, despite the fact that my closer friends were in Boston, California, Seattle, Michigan and Germany. Numerous people offered to drive me to the airport at 7 AM on a Thursday - some of the busiest time on the Mass Pike - and pick me up the following Tuesday at 5 AM. When my friends and I arrived in California the weekend of the services, Thomas (who lives near Jessica's family) and his family picked us up from the airport, let us stay in their home, fed us, and took us around to spend time coping with our loss together. Throughout the six days I was away from Olin, I still heard from people and talked to them. Some of my classmates who were closer to Matt and Rachel helped me prepare my remarks for Jessica's memorial service, which I gave to a chapel packed beyond capacity with her friends and family. Olin students from the classes of 2009, 2010 and 2011 were at the memorial service in California, in addition to President Miller and Dean Murdoch. My heart was uplifted by everybody who was there, and I know Jessica's family was touched by our presence that day.\u000a\u000aSome of the Olin students who were able to attend the memorial service in California.\u000aWhat I saw at Olin was three hundred college students genuinely caring about each other and taking action to ensure that nobody slipped through the cracks - their actions speak much more than my words.  My classmates reached out over thousands of miles, countless time zones, busy summer work schedules and hectic lives to talk to each other. My closest friends along with people who I hardly ever spent time with during the year wanted to make sure I was fine, that I was talking to people and dealing with my grief. We have supported each other during the worst of times, and I know that my friends and I will always have people at Olin who will be looking out for us. We hope you will keep the Olin community and Jessica's family and friends in your hearts and minds during these toughest of times.\u000a

aV\u000aSo around 3000 miles ago, life was good. Now, 3000 miles and 6 weeks later, life is even more awesome. I'm William, a first year from sunny San Diego, California and I cannot begin to explain how awesome Olin is (even though the west coast is still the best coast).\u000aWell, actually, I can begin to explain, but I don't think I could ever hope to finish. (read: prepare for the cliche but oh so true statements) The moment I stepped onto campus, it already felt like everyone here was a part of my family: it's only been 6 weeks, but it feels like I've known people here for years. I can just walk into the dining hall and sit down at any table and have a conversation with whoever is sitting there (this includes professors!) and I can send out an email about a pickup game of Ultimate and people will show up ready to play.\u000aThe other day I was walking out of class and I told Mark Somerville, who has written several books and has a PhD from MIT, "Bye Mark, have a great weekend!" It felt so weird, but it also felt so great, and it gives you a good idea about how the student-faculty dynamic works here. Most faculty at Olin prefer to be called by their first name and are not just our professors, but also our colleagues, mentors, and friends. Just this past weekend, I went out with my faculty advisor (Jessica Townsend) and our group of advising students to Sky Zone, an indoor trampoline park, and had a great time jumping around and playing trampoline dodgeball.\u000aOther than being friends with all the faculty and staff, we all are nuts about group work. Before I came to Olin, I was accustomed to just locking myself in my room and studying until the job was done. Now, it's harder for me to do work alone in my room because, well, you need help from others and you want to also help others. Just this past week, I was sitting in a lounge late at night (or early morning depending on how you look at it) and working on a lab for Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation, and Measurement (Olin's version of an Intro to Circuits class) and whenever I needed help, there always seemed to be a person awake and willing to help me. Our labs for ISIM (our awesome acronym for that class) are due the day we have the lab section for that class, and the next day, I spent a good deal of time running around helping people who had the same lab due the next day. The tips and tricks I learned the previous day helped several people complete their lab at not-post-midnight, and it made me feel great.\u000aMichael Costello, also a freshman, singing to other freshmen as they try to beat Solidworks into submission for a Design Nature assignment.\u000aThe strange thing about ISIM though, is that it is an entirely new course... being tested out on the freshmen... who are the only ones who ever take that class. Last year (and a few years before that), the course was called (or at least the acronym was) ModCon. ModCon was taught first semester freshman year and then followed by a class called ModWorm during second semester. The faculty constantly collect feedback in an effort to improve courses, and it actually bears fruit. The faculty in charge of ModCon and ModWorm decided to take what students felt were the most useful/awesome/fun parts of ModCon and ModWorm and combined it into a 1 semester course. This all goes to show how fast change can happen here - it still kind of shocks me when I realize I'm taking a class that was never offered before.\u000aIn news other than classes, there is a thing called Pass No Record for your first semester of freshman year. What that means is: if all your classes first semester are taken pass/fail and if you do not pass a class, it will not show up on your transcript. What that means Olin wants you to do is:\u000a\u000aWhat Pass No Record enables you to do isnotslack off, but to join every club or student organization you could ever possibly be interested in and not be afraid of totally crashing your GPA. For example, I am in/on the Ultimate Frisbee team, Cheerios (a-capella group), SASE (Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers), OFAC (Olin Fire Arts Club), REVO (Research in Electric Vehicles at Olin), SLAC (Stay Late and Create/Code), ORS (Olin Robotic Sailing), OVAL (Olin Volunteer Ambassadors League), OWW (Olin's Nerf Club), and WHACK (a group of students who want to learn/do fencing). Most of those are student orgs and REVO and ORS are large project groups, which means you work in subteams on a large project. REVO wants to build an electric car and compete in Formula SAE and ORS wants to build a robotic sailboat that can complete a transatlantic voyage. I obviously need to pare down my committments, because sleep is apparentlynota thing for me right now.\u000aOn top of all our lovely student run organizations and teams, I'm also taking the standard freshman first semester load of 4 courses. I already told you about ISIM, but I'm also taking Design Nature (bio-inspired design class), Modeling and Simulation of the Real World (exactly what it sounds like - it teaches you how to take real world systems and implement them with models), and Robots, Mutants, and Monsters: Envisioning Science in Cinema (class where we watch and analyze awesome sci-fi movies). ISIM, DesNat, and ModSim (yep, acronyms) are classes that every freshman takes first semester, but the last class, which I shall refer to as "the robot movie class" is called an AHSE (Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entreprenuership) class, which you get to choose (being a well-rounded engineering is important)! Your class choices definitely start freeing up next semester, but I find the three required courses quite refreshing - they open up your mind to new possiblities of things that you can do in the engineering field. I came into Olin almost dead set on majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering, but now I'm no longer 100% that's exactly what I want to do.\u000aI guess after those long paragraphs, a semi-decent way to summarize Olin so far would be this: I have never been in a place where everyone is so willing to help each other. If you need help, someone will help you. If someone needs help, you will want to help them. If you have a passion for anything - you can and will pursue it.\u000a

aV\u000aI am embarrassed to say that until last month, I had not gone to a concert since arriving at Olin last August. With only 18 miles (or 1 hour, 20 min if you take the T) between Needham and Boston, this is simply unacceptable... until you add on the busy Olin schedule I'm part of and the exciting activities that take place here. But while the semester was still winding up, 7 Oliners and myself managed to escape the Olin bubble for a night of skanking, the official dance of the ska punk scene. That's right, a rocking concert by the original sell outs, The Reel Big Fish.\u000a\u000aLook close and you might be able to see Chris Gallello. ('12) at the railing at the front of the pit at the Reel Big Fish concert at Palladium.\u000a\u000aI assure you, nothing rocks harder than being smashed up against the front railing of a concert so hard that you know the make and model of cell phone the guy behind you has based on its shape. And you know you're not finished until you've exchanged BO with at least a hundred other screaming fans. Returning home, at least one of your extremities must ache for at least a week. Broken toenails and arms rubbed raw by your fellow skankers are just a sign of a good night.\u000aTo earn these privileges (and more) all 8 of us had the interesting experience of standing outside on a cold, 15 degree Worcester night for an hour. Everyone was horridly under-dressed. And to boot, we decided against bringing jackets into the venue and had Chris G ('12) run our clothes to the car 10 minutes before opening. Standing outside in t-shirts, we huddled together into a human amoeba to stave off hypothermia. We literally became closer friends, sharing such a wild experience; knowing that we couldn't have stood the cold without each other.\u000aIt was a night of firsts for me. This was the first time I'd been to a concert since Olin/with Oliners. That night was my first time seeing any ska band live. And this was the first time someone from my crowd snagged one of the band's freebees. That accomplishment goes to Chris G. ('12) who caught the pick of Aaron Barrett, lead guitarist and singer. Chris caught the pick Aaron actually played with, not one of the extras he had in his mic stand to throw to skanking fans. Chris's comment: "perhaps playing baseball is useful for something."\u000a\u000aChris caught a pop fly!\u000aSo candidates, as you visit, be sure to ask any of our crowd about our experience.\u000aReel Big Fishermen: Chris G. ('12), Abe F. ('12), Ali S. ('12), Nat M. ('12), Mike M. ('12), Kevin S. ('12), Lauren G. ('09), and me, Colin Z. ('12).\u000aWondering what your Oliners are doing during the weeks leading up to Candidates Weekend? They're staying rocksome by attending the Girl Talk concert at Wellesley\u000a\u000aThe Olin Student Activities Committee managed to get subsidized tickets for Girl Talk's visit to nearby Wellesley College. Sadly, I didn't get one, but look forward to posts from those who did.\u000aColin\u000a

aV\u000aStrange, how is one best to start a piece of writing? How about their inaugural post to blogdom?\u000aIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times; it was the age of... no not really that age.\u000aPerhaps I need look no further than my fellow bloggers and their opening posts.\u000aI could say that I'm the new Freshman (class of 2012) blogger, but some of predecessors didn't seem to find the step necessary--Maia, in her first ever student blog post, jumped straight in with her new bed, and Roland with John Geddes' dog. But it isn't quite fair to say they didn't have proper introductions, they are seasoned bloggers and were probably had introductions on the Olin blog aggregate (the precursor to the official blog you're reading now).\u000aI could start with a confession,\u000a        or three, as Angela did (lying about her degree, sporadic procrastinator, and Thai food lover). "I confess I don't know  how to start." You probably guessed already.\u000aI could start with romance. "Oh alum, prospectives, parents, olinophiles. I know not how to tell thee who I am." But that doesn't beat Bennett's opening post and its "painful, poignant parting," signs of a true helpless romantic. Jessi's post appears romantic at first glance, but is only as romantic as romanticism (just the title, "This could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship"), so I ought not copy her.\u000aPerhaps I should start with a proposal: a new tradition. I propose that all future student bloggers propose something their first post. That they compare and contrast each other, that they include a picture of themselves doing a handstand on top of a pancake. Except that I don't have such a picture and Olin is rather anti-tradition.\u000aEnough of this foolry. Hello all, I am Colin Zwiebel, second generation in the search for freshman bloggers. I am into all kinds of random things and look nothing like my picture (facial hair, not sure its a good thing, though). OLPC and the XO are a few of those things and provided the title of this post. In my failing to properly test Fedora Linux on my XO (a gadget I'm earning by being Red Hat Inc's testing grunt for October), I couldn't help noticing a line in the console output during boot. So I figured I'd pay homage some poor code monkey and title my post after his work (oh, bias of immediacy).\u000aBut what about the future? I think this post is the first in a long line of Zwiebel meta-Olin posts. What is Olin all about, how is it really different, what is the class of 2012 like, what about accredation, which Olin programs should be sacked by the 5th of November and rebuilt from the ground up, what makes a good engineer, what makes an engineer that will change the world and change it in a positive direction, who is the craziest oliner, what are the awesomest clubs/activites/sports/jobs/professors...\u000aJust a few of the topics I would like to discuss. Just teases, you only get to salivate over them for now.\u000aBut I will follow suit of (most of) my fellow bloggers and their inaugural posts and tell you a recent happening. I visited the inaugural IEEE Humanitarian Conference at Boston University yesterday. Overall, an interesting experience. In the spirit of learning by making mistakes (an Olin favorite, you will soon learn), I present some actions that should and should not be taken in regards to conferences:\u000ado: go crazy, jump head first (IE, register days before, become an IEEE member last minute, even though your a undergrad freshman)\u000adon't: arrive late and miss all the speakers (even if you have physical therapy and your Sibb gives advice otherwise)\u000ado: heed the advice of Colleen O'Holleran (Chapter Manager, EWB-USA) when she says that regional, language, logistics, management, and other issues are by far the largest part of humanitarian engineering (or, I believe, most engineering, these days)\u000aAnd no matter what else you do or don't do:\u000adon't ask grad students for help ("All I know on Boston University Campus is the Law Tower")\u000aColin\u000aP.S. You should follow me on Twitter: http://twitter.com/computercolin , I don't post about food and try to tweet amusing tid-bits. Plus, fewer words.\u000aEdit (21 Oct 08):\u000aAlso\u000adon't write blog posts at 2am (or at least don't publish them)!\u000aFound so many errors!119\u000a

aV\u000aFinals Week\u000a\u000aIt would be great if I could end this post here. I have been in the lab for six or seven hours trying to get my Principles of Engineering project to work (due tomorrow). I have a solid four hours of sleep under my belt, and if I play my cards right I might get four more tonight.\u000aYep, definitely finals week. I can't tell you it's not brutal. But hey, finals is brutal everywhere. Today I want to talk about the particular brand of nightmarish, apocalyptic terror that is unique to Olin.\u000aDid I mention Finals Week is kind of awesome? Seriously.\u000aOnly two of my finals are actually exams. The rest are team projects that are due by the end of the semester. Finals week has a totally different feel when the pain is shared with five friends. Also, turning in my 3-axis QuadRotor mounted gimbal with ground tracking will be way more fun than turning in a monster test or a paper.\u000aWhen your finals are projects, finals week is less like a strange high-stakes game for college students and more like a simulation of the project crunch times you will deal with time and again as an engineer. I never feel like I waste my time with Olin finals because the result is always extremely rewarding. Projects often consume daunting amounts of time, but nothing says team bonding like a meeting from one-thirty to done-thirty with a dominoes break in the middle. Seeing your personal baby work flawlessly after 16 straight hours of work is an amazing feeling. I can't quite describe what it's like to walk back to West Hall in the snow at 5 a.m. with your genius, unstoppable team who pushed through and rolled over every obstacle together.\u000aA Software Design team on the home stretch. All I understood from their explanation is "the code works!".\u000aOf course, we do have real tests. I still have to work through my take-home exam for Dynamics, my intensive mechanical modelling course. Un-timed take-homes ease the pressure a little, but the test will likely take a whole day and it won't be easy. Even with solo finals like this, however, fellow Oliners make it all bearable.\u000aAside from watching my projects come together, my favorite part of Olin finals week is how the whole student body comes together for each other. People who find themselves with free time bake cookies for people who can't afford a food break, and seniors stop by to offer advice on that pesky bug you just can't work out. Even staff ramp up their dedication; my professor stopped by the lab at 11 to offer some last-minute advice and encouragement, and the dining hall served midnight breakfast today. Everyone asks everyone else what they are working on and commiserates over the workload. It is a crazy, busy, impossible mess, and everyone drags each other through.\u000aThis guy is still awake helping PoE teams. He should really be getting paid.\u000aWith a community as smart and awesome as this one, high-stress situations are just another challenge for us to work through together, like an uncooperative circuit or a broken chunk of code. Everyone does their part of the job and tries to help those who get stuck. We come through finals week with new friendships, forged in the fires of desperate 11 p.m. work sessions and equally important desperate 7-11 runs. The student body stumbles their way into winter break exhausted, hungry, and burnt out, but also a winner. And then they all get some well-deserved sleep.\u000aWow, I can't wait to sleep again.\u000a

aV\u000aIn honor of Candidates' Weekends, I have brilliantly Google searched for "questions to ask on a college tour," stolen such questions from other websites, revised them, and answered them from my perspective.  (Don't let that stop you from asking others, though; I am certainly not representative of the entire student body.)\u000aCandidates' Weekend is a time not just for us to find out more about you, but for you to find out more about us--to find out if you really do want to spend four years of your life here.  Talk to students.  Ask lots of questions.  This post is meant to serve as inspiration for you, so you can make the most out of your time here.  Good luck!\u000a        \u000aI borrowed the first part of the list of questions from EducationPlanner.org's "Questions to Ask on a Campus Tour" page.\u000a1. Are the dorms spread throughout the campus or clustered in one area? Is there any kind of shuttle service between classroom areas, the library, the student union, and dorms? How late does it run?\u000aIf you know Olin, this question seems silly at first.  There are 5 main buildings.  They are all right next to each other.  Having a shuttle would be laughable.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOlin's campus, as viewed from the soccer field.  (Photo courtesy of the olinimages flickr account--and probably Michael J. Maloney.)\u000a\u000aHowever, we are allowed and in fact encouraged to cross register at Wellesley College (and also Babson College--right next door--and Brandeis University, accessible by car or taxi), and there is a shuttle that runs regularly during weekdays between Wellesley, Babson, and Olin.\u000aOlin does not have a student union.\u000a2. Is there any security system to bar outsiders from entering dorms?\u000aYes.  Dorms can only be opened by key or prox card.  All students have access to both dorms by prox card, but your key will only let you into your own dorm.  Maintenance staff, public safety, and the Office of Student Life also have access to the dorms.\u000aLiving between Needham and Wellesley doesn't put us in much danger of break-ins and the like (ask about our campus crime statistics--they're quite low), but these security measures exist nevertheless.\u000a3. How large is the campus security police force? Does it patrol the campus regularly?\u000aIt's sufficiently large for a campus of 300 students, and it does patrol the campus regularly.  Public Safety officers, however, are not allowed to enter the dorms unless called in by either students or the Office of Student Life--in general, an officer in the dorms means something has gone wrong.\u000a4. What services are offered by the campus health center? How large is it?\u000aOlin doesn't have a health center, but we're allowed to use Babson's (it's really close by--definitely walking distance).  I've only ever been there to get my (free) flu shot. If you have concerns about this, you should make it a point to ask Olin's staff about it while you're visiting.\u000aWe also get free mental health care at Colony Care, which is a group of psychologists and psychiatrists in nearby Wellesley, and at a psychiatrist's office in Needham.\u000a5. Does the student health center refer students to the local hospital? Is there a nearby hospital? How large is it?\u000aI think the answer to this is yes, especially if it is on the weekend and it is an emergency.  There are several hospitals nearby, and which one you get taken to depends on which side of campus you are on when Public Safety/the ambulance picks you up. \u000a6. How many of your courses are taught by a big-name professor and how many by a teaching assistant?\u000aNo courses are taught by teaching assistants.  Many courses have course assistants, and it is rare (though not unheard of) for a course assistant to stand in when the professor cannot make it.  Additionally, certain first-year courses have extra (required) sessions that meet outside of normal class time and are taught by upperclassmen.\u000aI don't know that any of our faculty are "big-name," though they are not without impressive qualifications (and varied enthusiasms).  All professors hold a Ph.D., and I believe that all of them do research of some form.\u000a7. Is the teaching innovative and project-oriented, or is it mostly lecture-oriented?\u000aThe former.  If you've heard anything about Olin, you've probably heard that.  That, and the tuition scholarship, of course.  I encourage you to ask current students about projects that they're working on now, or cool projects that they've worked on in the past.  You're guaranteed to get at least some sort of interesting answer.\u000a8. Do most freshmen class lectures take place in an amphitheater?\u000aWe have an auditorium, and it is the preferred venue for class-wide lectures (75 students in total).  It's scarcely an amphitheater.  My freshman class fit (comfortably) into the first four rows.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aStudents in Olin's auditorium, spring 2008.  (Photo courtesy of the olinimages flickr account--and probably Michael J. Maloney.)\u000a\u000a9. What are the strong majors? The weak majors?\u000aThere are only three majors (Mechanical, Electrical, and General), and as for the strength of each, I am not qualified to comment, given that I only have direct experience in the most varied one (General).  This is certainly a good question to ask students and faculty members while you are visiting.\u000a10. How hard do you have to work for your grades?\u000aRather hard.  Olin's not at all cutthroat or competitive, though; grades mostly only matter (as long as you're passing) when you're applying for internships, jobs, REUs, grad schools, and the like.  We have some of the happiest and most hardworking students in the country (if you believe the Princeton Review).\u000a11. What's the reputation of the _____________ department?\u000aWe don't have departments.\u000a12. How adequate for your needs is the campus computer network?\u000aEvery student is issued (and pays for, one way or another) a laptop when they arrive, which is covered under a warranty for four years (except the battery, which only has a one year warranty and invariably becomes useless at about the end of one's sophomore year).  Olin has wireless internet, as well as ethernet ports all over the place (especially in the dorms and the Academic Center).  I would say that it's more than adequate for my needs, though wireless can get a little slow at certain times.\u000a13. Do fraternities and sororities dominate the social life of the college?\u000aThere are no (official) fraternities or sororities.  If this interests you, though, I encourage you to ask current students about unofficial social groups.\u000a14. What do students do on weekends? Do most go home?\u000aMost of Olin's students come from out-of-state; few go home on weekends.  Weekend activities are many and varied; you should ask students this when you arrive on campus.\u000aOn the weekends, I generally do a mix of fun stuff and work, where fun stuff may include shopping, trips into Boston, restaurants, bars, movies, cooking, napping, parties, and so on.\u000a15. How is the advisement system? Do you feel that your professors really care?\u000aEvery first year student is assigned an adviser; this adviser may be changed at the end of each year (but in truth, probably at any time if there is a compelling reason to switch).  I personally do feel that my professors care--quite a lot--and I would imagine that you would be hard-pressed to find an Olin student who feels differently.  I may be wrong.  Find out for yourselves.\u000a16. There are a lot of organizations on campus. Are they dominated by a few groups or is anyone welcome?\u000aAnyone is welcome.  Olin has something like one club per 5 or 6 students, and starting a new club is incredibly easy.  There are many other opportunities for involvement, as well--Honor Board, CORe (the student government), and SERV (the community service board) are all elected positions.  Committee positions (there are also many committees, including my own, the illustrious Student Activities Committee) are appointed by CORe, for the most part.  Additionally, there are many more organizations that are volunteer-based.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Council of Olin Representatives (CORe) General Assembly at our retreat in the Massachusetts State House, fall 2008.\u000a\u000aThe ACT website's college planning section offers further questions (note that I am polling selectively):\u000a17. What activities and services are available to help students get settled (academically and socially) during their first year?\u000aAll the first-year technical courses have course assistants who hold regular office hours and are very willing to help.  Additionally, faculty members hold regular office hours, and frequently respond to e-mail requests for help, even at odd hours.\u000aEach floor in Olin's dorms where students live has at least one R2, or Resident Resource.  They are available to talk, especially to first-year students who are having a difficult time adjusting.  And, as mentioned previously, free mental health services--including plain old counseling--are available to all Olin students.\u000a18. How big are the classes?\u000aIt varies a lot.  Some classes have 75-student lectures (always with a smaller, 25-student studio/laboratory session), and some classes end up having, say, 2 students in them by the time the course ends.  I would say that in my experience, the average class size is probably in the 15-20 students range.  Ish.\u000a19. How easy is it to meet with faculty?\u000aIt depends heavily on the faculty member, but with most faculty members, it is quite easy.  They usually have office hours at some point during the week, and are often more than willing to set up meetings by e-mail.  Also, they sometimes eat lunch/dinner with us in the Dining Hall, which is nice.\u000a20. Are students able to register for the classes they want?\u000aFor the most part, yes.  It is a very small school, and some classes are only offered once every two years, or once every three semesters, and it can get a little tricky.  I have not had any huge disappointments or frustrations though, no.\u000a21. What activities are available for students?\u000aSo many!  I mentioned ways to get involved before, but it's also possible to enjoy activities put on by clubs and SAC and such without actually joining.  Clubs put on events mostly irregularly (last week, for example, I helped Cheese Club make macaroni and cheese--and it was delicious), and SAC generally puts on about one event every week or two.  This Friday, for example, is a movie kick-out to see "Watchmen."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOlin's winter formal ("Wintry Mixer," put on by Student Activities Committee), at the beginning of the event.  The crowd in the back is for the casino games (we gave everybody $100 in play money to gamble away).\u000a\u000a22. How successful are the college's graduates in finding jobs?\u000aIn general, very successful.  This year...  Ask again later.\u000a23. What services (such as transportation and shopping) are available locally?\u000aBesides the shuttle and taxi service (taxis will take you to our mental health facilities and Brandeis University for free, and you can always pay for one to take you elsewhere), you're mostly stuck bumming rides off your friends, or driving yourself (parking at Olin is free!).  There are several grocery stores (of varying quality) within a mile or two, including a Trader Joe's (more like 2.5 miles, but close enough) and a Whole Foods (more like 3.5 miles away).  Needham and Wellesley both have a number of restaurants (Italian food, Thai food, Indian food, pizza, bagels, Starbucks, etc.), and Wellesley has a few retail stores (like the Gap, for example).  There's also an extensive mall about 20 minutes away in Natick.\u000aFinally, my own questions:\u000a24. What is your least favorite thing about Olin?\u000aIt comes down to a few things: Dining Hall dinners where the vegetarian options were thoughtlessly paired (angel hair pasta with tomatoes, for example, when the side is rice and the meet entrees are curries, or tofu stir fry when the side is linguini and the meat entrees are chicken parmesan and the like), the therapy mailing list (as you may know, I hate it quite a lot, though I am, for the record, now unsubscribed), and too much snow.  Snow was all well and good when I was a freshman, but I'm getting pretty sick of it at this point.  It's getting to be time for a change of scenery.\u000a25. What is your favorite thing about Olin?\u000aThis answer varies depending on my mood and what I'm thinking about at the time.  I usually say it's the supportive, close-knit community.  The full-tuition scholarship doesn't hurt.  I find the curriculum interesting (and hands-on and innovative and worthwhile).  I like knowing the names of my professors, and having them (for the most part) know my name.  I also really like the Dining Hall's cheese tortellini (usually served at brunch every other Sunday or so--yummm).\u000aMore questions?  Just ask!\u000aCheers,\u000aAngela\u000a\u000a

aV\u000a        First things first.If you are having trouble deciphering things, Chris Morse will give you the answer you seek. He's the puzzles champ around here!---- A month ago, I didn't even understand the co-curricular. Two weeks ago I finally got around to stopping by the meetings. Last week I signed up for the competition on a lark, and yesterday, I traveled to Microsoft headquarters in the Cambridge area with four other Olin teams to test our mettle in a nationwide college puzzles competition. \u000aWe left out of here at 10 am and settled in there to begin the enterprise at noon. We returned long after midnight. \u000aMy team consisted of Trevor, me, and Paul (all '13), and Nat ('12).\u000aWe had jumped on a newly formed vacancy late-ish into the sign up process, in the middle of our 'puzzles' gathering. Our combined inexperience averaged around five sessions each, so we entitled ourselves "CannonFodder," below the others, "The Ultraviolet Catastrophe," "Drop Table Teams," "Ground Control," and "Captain Morgan." We named every individual in our team "Graham Hooton," but we each had our own e-mail addresses. Signing in on Saturday morning was a little awkward, but it made congratulating one another very easy.\u000a\u000a\u000a        At HQ, we settled in at the end of a spacious lounge-area with many\u000atelevision monitors, studio spaces, and divans spread about. We noticed\u000aour free tee shirts had a curious pattern printed on them. We decided\u000ait was our first puzzle, so we set about solving it before the packets\u000awere delivered. We were very quick on another, so the minute we were\u000aable to submit, we managed to be the first team to submit two answers,\u000aputting us first around the country very (very!) briefly.\u000aOne\u000ainnovative puzzle involved a change in the submission protocol on the\u000awebsite. A new paragraph appeared in the rules: "It has come to our\u000aattention that underhanded techniques are messing up the process.\u000aContestants shall note that it is strictly forbidden to bribe\u000athe event co-ordinators." Guess where the hyperlinked word 'bribe'\u000asent us to! A hidden puzzle, entitled "DO AS YOU'RE TOLD." What could\u000awe do? I ran out to Dunkin Donuts and bought them donut holes. \u000aBy\u000athe end of the day, after our submissions of the correct answer to the\u000athirty challenge puzzles gradually unlocked sections of a video, we put\u000aclues together to hypothesize that voice-acting legend, Don Lafontaine,\u000awould be the final response. My teammate typed it in, but it wasn't\u000aquite right. I then remembered that we were looking for 'some person's\u000acatch phase' but instead of inputting "IN A WORLD WHERE", we moved on!\u000aWe could have had it! We got distracted from the final puzzle at the\u000aworst moment!\u000a... so, in fact these were not my experiences. My\u000abetter practiced fellow Oliners accomplished these feats - my stories\u000awere similar, but I wasn't as quick or long-distance and I didn't quite\u000afinish. Despite being cannon fodder, however, my\u000awet-behind-the-ears team figured out a respectable number of puzzles\u000aand wound up with a score that we found very satisfactory.\u000aIt\u000awas all such a wonderful experience, and it couldn't have happened\u000awithout our co-curricular (official assembly of students instructed in\u000aa professor's given extra curricular interest) leader and\u000apuzzlesmaster, Chris Morse (also a chemistry professor). He prepared us\u000awell for this event, training us in the weeks before, giving us packets\u000aof past years' puzzles to get us into the right mindset. He sent us a\u000acarefully planned document filled with codes and ciphers, lists and\u000aresources. He also suggested a number of tools we should bring with us\u000aincluding dice, dominoes, scrabble tiles, and scissors to help us in\u000amyriad ways. \u000aOur groups worked in relative isolation for\u000atwelve hours, chatting briefly while fetching snacks and drinks but\u000ahurrying back to focus.Within the group, we got to know one another\u000avery well, seeing a side of each other only hours of dictated\u000acompanionship brings to light. It's an experience I'm hoping to repeat,\u000aand even improve upon, next year!So, to all those involved, thank\u000ayou my very enjoyable saturday morning, afternoon, and evening, and\u000acongratulations, all the puzzlers, Chris Morse, and Microsoft!\u000aThe puzzles can be found here.\u000a

aV\u000aOne clause of Olin's Honor Code is entitled "Do Something", and states the following:\u000a"I will strive to better myself and my community and take responsibility for my own behavior. When I become aware of a violation of the Honor Code or an issue within the community, I will take action towards resolution of the situation. I expect others to do the same"\u000aWhile this clause can be interpreted to focus on issues and violations of the Honor Code, to take action to resolve problems that arise, I have found an alternate meaning in the Honor Code's "Do Something" clause. If I have something that I want to do; a change I wish to make, a place I want to go, or an idea I want to solidify, then it is my responsibility to make that happen. The Do Something clause has taught me how to empower creativity and change.\u000aStudents may sometimes get lost in their work and forget what it feels like to take a moment and relax, reflect, or do something silly. When those moments do happen, amazing ideas occur. Those moments, when minimal thought is given to the work you actually have to finish, create beautiful things. A few nights ago, a few Olin students decided that they should go arrange some leaves out in the "O" in the middle of the night. What they ended up creating shows just how amazing people can be when they have an interesting idea that they want to pursue, and it brought smiles to the face of everyone who noticed.\u000aLeaf art made by a few spontaneously creative Oliners.\u000aLast weekend, I fractured my hand. How did I do this, you may ask? Well, another student and I had an idea that we wanted to come true. We wanted to operate giant robots. A few months ago, Olin alumnus and past professor Gui Cavalcanti helped create MegaBots, a Kickstarter campaign with a grand plan to bring giant robot combat into reality. The MegaBots team recently offered a challenge: whoever could make the most convincing video about why they wanted to be a MegaBots pilot could win a chance to pilot a MegaBot. This challenge prompted me to drop what I was doing and think: why not make a super awesome video about why I want to drive giant robots? Yea, sure, I tripped and fractured my hand in the process. But being part of something creative and amazing is worth the trip (pun intended). Here was the end result:\u000a\u000a\u000aHaving the time and the mental energy to spend on doing what you love is incredibly satisfying and rewarding. Not only do you get to have fun and goof off, but also you get to have fun and take on some pretty daunting challenges not because you have to, because they are for school or work or research, but because you think that no matter how much time it will take, you know it will be pretty cool. So I challenge all those reading this: over Thanksgiving break, explore your creativity. Delve into your passions. Do something awesome.\u000aAlex Crease, c/o 2016\u000a

aV\u000aThis semester I've been taking a co-curricular (read: faculty-led just-for-fun class) in food science, taught by one of our materials science professors, Debbie. This is one of the most in-demand co-curricular, filling up less than ten seconds after co-curricular registration began. Over the semester we covered topics ranging from crystal growth to collagen, and chocolate to eggs. Each time we would meet in the kitchen, discussing the latest readings and making recipes that were appropriate for the week. For our final class, we decided to have a food science potluck, where everyone would make one item and explain the science behind it.\u000aThe first dish we had was ceviche, made by Nik and Nina. Ceviche involves cooking fish with acid (from lime juice) instead of with heat, the way we usually think of cooking. We had sweet potatoes and a traditional Peruvian purple-corn drink with it. Here's Nina with the ceviche as it was in the finishing portion of cooking:\u000a\u000aOur full dinner consisted of:\u000aCeviche with sweet potatoes\u000aKung Pao Chicken (made by our own Jessie)\u000aBanana muffins (half with gluten and half without)\u000aBaked Alaska\u000aHomemade cheese\u000aFrench-style Meat- a traditional Russian meal with meat, potatoes, and cheese\u000a\u000aHere is Jessie working on her Kung Pao Chicken in one of Olin's dorm kitchens.\u000aKate changed her dish last minute, so it didn't have a ton to do with food science, but it was one of the most delicious. This is why I love old family recipes.\u000a\u000aMy contribution was homemade salted and herbed butter. It came out quite good- we used both the shaking method, passing it around as the other things cooked, and the electric-mixer method. In the end, FoodLab was an excellent (and tasty!) end to my final day of classes. It was also fun to touch on a number of food science topics that we hadn't really covered during the rest of the semester. This has been a great experience for me, and I'm now considering doing my required Olin Self-Study in a food science area.\u000aThis is planning for later, though. I'm now in the wonderful pre-finals phase, as I also scramble to get everything set up for this summer and next semester. I have been accepted to an art program in Florence next year, so I'm looking forward to taking a semester abroad to paint pictures, draw portraits, make hats, and see the sights. All I need to worry about now is getting a visa and learning some more Italian.\u000aUntil later,\u000aJessi\u000a

aV\u000aI'm designing a robotic puffer fish, 3D printing functional dynamic assemblies, making E. Coli glow in the dark, and hopefully sending out an autonomous robotic sailboat to cross the Atlantic Ocean by the end of this school year. I don't think there is any way to phrase how absurd this semester has been so far. What does all this stuff even mean? I don't even know where to start.\u000aThe robotic pufferfish I am designing for my Mechanical Design class\u000a   I guess I'll start with freshman year at Olin. While I was a first year, graduation was a long way off. I didn't really know much, and I knew I didn't really know much. All of these really cool upperclassmen were running around doing insane things like building calligraphy writing robots, leading project teams, and creating massive, school wide events like Build Day. All of these things were so out of this world, so inspiring, and so exciting, and as a first year I didn't think I'd be doing anything like that in the near future.\u000a I can't really wrap my head around the idea that I may have become one of those people that I looked up to my freshman year. Do I really know what I'm doing? The answer is yes and no. There will always be room to learn more, and there will always be areas of study that I'm not too sure about. I may feel like some of my classes are a struggle because I'm not quite sure what is going on. However, those classes are tricky for the same reason that I'm taking them; because I haven't learned the material yet. Have I really learned that much? Well, that's where Olin's project based learning structure comes into play. Parents are always looking for toys for their children that are secretly educational. Toys that will help children learn, without letting the kid in on the secret that there is some educational experience in the game they are playing. Things like ant farms, that not only are cool to look at, but also teach kids about ecology, or Scrabble, which is secretly a test of spelling, vocabulary, and geometry (if this one isn't quite clear, I find Scrabble to be a very interesting space-packing problem; i.e. how can you fit the most amount of tiles in one turn the least amount of space?). I have found Olin to be an incredibly amazing, lifelong, secretly educational toy.\u000a\u000aThe Olin Robotic Sailing team's most recent boat,Damn Yankee, on display at Expo last semester. This semester we will be working to design and manufacture a boat that has the potential to cross the Atlantic Ocean.\u000a    So somehow, I've learned all of these new things without realizing it, and as I look back on all of the projects I've worked on and I'm currently working on, I am constantly surprised at how much I have evolved, and how much I really have learned just working on them. By focusing on project based learning, Olin has really helped me learn how to tacklereal worldprojects through my excitement for the school and for the projects that I have worked on. Even though I know I haven't learned everything about every type of system, through these projects I can see that I've learned how to teach myself what I need to know in order to tackle a difficult problem.\u000a-Alex, c/o 2016\u000a

p1960
aVMy answer? 
p1961
aVYes!
p1962
aVShe replied, "New friend! I'm Kimly!"
p1963
aVWe spent tons of time together during CW, from Friday night activities,
p1964
aVto exploring the dorms on Saturday night, to staying up late in the BECC.
p1965
aVWe've been friends ever since.
p1966
aVWe have also been roommates for the past two
p1967
aVyears, and I'm so glad things worked out how they have.
p1968
aVThe very first night, different
p1969
aVgroups of students host various activities.
p1970
aVOne such activity at our weekend was 'bowling like a MechE.'
p1971
aVWe were given a wooden frame of sorts, some
p1972
aVtime, and a table full of objects, and told to make a system that could send a
p1973
aVball into a stack of cups.
p1974
aVAfter coming
p1975
aVup with three different ideas that all seemed solid, our entire system
p1976
aVcollapsed 2 minutes before our first iteration.
p1977
aVWe ended up Duct taping long piece of PVC pipe to the wood, took a
p1978
aVhammer with us, and headed outside.
p1979
aVTurns out, hitting the ball through the PVC pipe worked
p1980
aVwonderfully!
p1981
aVFor our second iteration,
p1982
aVwe secured everything a bit more with nails and additional pieces of 2x4...and decided to test it while inside.
p1983
aVThis time, we whacked a water-filled bocce
p1984
aVball with a piece of 2x4, and were surprised when nothing came out the other
p1985
aVend, but water dripped out the PVC.
p1986
aVNeedless to say, we were memorable!
p1987
aVYes, this seems logical, but I
p1988
aVcannot stress enough how amazing the last night of CW was.
p1989
aVA large group of us were staying in the BECC,
p1990
aVso we hung out at the end of the hall by a computer and the elevators.
p1991
aV This picture includes Dan Kearney, Abe Kim, Jason Zhu, Adriana Garties, and other students who attended other schools [not to mention Kimly, Oren, and Murphy Kitchell, who are not pictured but were there as well].

aV\u000aDear Reader,\u000aImagine, if you will: Finals are approaching, steadily, on the horizon. Classes have just ended, and a meager three days are left before the oncoming mass of due dates. And what will Olin students be doing?\u000a\u000aNow, "finishing projects" or "making posters" are perfectly reasonable guesses, but this is Olin we're talking about.\u000aWe decided last year that three days between the end of classes and the start of finals is much too much, and decided to do something special with one of them. And thus, Build Day was born.\u000aWhat is "Build Day," you ask?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a(See more @BuildOlin.)\u000aBuild Day is the day when the whole Olin community (students, faculty, staff, administration--everyone) gets together and says, "We love this place. But we want to make it better." Some really awesome projects happened, and there was planting, discussing, and baking galore. The Dining Hall even got into it, having Build Your Own Pizza, Hamburgers, Tacos, and Cupcakes for lunch. It was an incredible event to be a part of, and I can't wait for Build Day 2015. (Well actually I can, because I can't even think about being halfway to graduation. Which leads me to...)\u000aCongrats to Olin's Class of 2018!\u000a\u000aYou've all worked really hard to make it here, and Nagy's blog the a few days ago was 100% true. So relax! I have a feeling you made the right choice. You'll be here this fall...\u000a\u000aSee ya real soon!\u000aMichael, c/o '17\u000a

aV\u000aTechnically published a day early. Oh well.\u000aHello out there! This is actually my first post for this school year, so let me introduce myself: I am Jennifer, the invisible blogger (look under the list of bloggers; I'm not there), and a Junior this year. Pleased to meet you!\u000aThere's something about Olin that I have been thinking about for some time now, and the rapid approach of November has made this even more evident (I'll explain why in a moment). Specifically, the way that Olin kind of makes everyone who comes here into the same person. Or, perhaps, we are all extremely similar even before we arrive. Olin's size means that is actually possible: Oliners self-select to be similar. However, that's not always a good thing, because by becoming part of Olin, you have a tendency to forget aspects of yourself. Among people who are constantly working on engineering, staying up until all hours of the night to perfect that last little piece of a project, and generally being perfectionists you become those people.\u000aThat was basically what happened to me Freshman year, but I have attempted very hard to change that. I don't particularly want to be a stereotypical engineer--obsessed with perfection, constantly at work on code or in the machine shop working on some new part--because there are so many other things to do in the world. A great example of this is the fact that I do NaNoWriMo.\u000a\u000aNaNoWriMo stands for National Novel Writing Month, and occurs every year in November (see why I mentioned it earlier?). I have participated in NaNoWriMo for the past 5 years, and won the past 4, which means that I have completed a 50,000 word novel in the 30 days of November every year for 4 years. At Olin, people are constantly surprised at this: however for me even the thought of not writing a novel a year is depressing. It gives me a solid object that is completely unrelated to engineering that I can point to and say "I did that." Not to mention, writing 1,667 words every day is really a lovely break from engineering projects. It's just so different, and working through words rather than numbers and programming languages (admittedly still words, but of a different sort) means that you can see the world in a completely new way. It lets me exercise creative muscles that I don't typically use in STEM related fields.\u000aAnother example of doing something completely un-Olin/engineering related is what I spent this last summer dong. While literally every other single person I knew from Olin was doing an internship, research project, or studying in some brand of engineering (more than half of them staying at Olin to do so) I worked as a horse wrangler at a ranch in the Rocky Mountains. This entailed working with and interacting with people who were very different from what I was used to at Olin. Most of my coworkers had majored in something horse-related or hadn't gone to college at all. As for the guests...I was basically working a service industry job. And I must say: Never Again. Dealing with people who expected everything to be perfect, and not being able to deliver was extremely stressful, and I swear I will never get mad at people working in that industry for being stressed or slow EVER AGAIN. But that being said, it was a fantastic experience. I got to see a view of the world that I feel is often never seen by Oliners. Far away from civilization, a minimum of modern technology, and living every day with 120 horses. Which, when they're this cute, is just the best thing ever.\u000a\u000aThis is Joey.\u000a\u000aAnd this is Joker. They're two of my favorites.\u000aSo, you might be asking, what is the point of this long explanation of non-engineering things? Well, I'll tell you. Basically, don't tie yourself to forever doing only engineering-related things. There's a whole lot more out in the world to experience.\u000aAlso, although I didn't actually end up discussing this a lot, but I still feel that it is important to say, don't feel like everything you do has to be perfect. At Olin, you are surrounded by AMAZING people, who can do PHENOMENAL things, and sometimes it feels impossible to do anything that can compare. But you will always have something that is essentially you, and it's very important that you keep that spark of individuality. That's what will make you stand out as an interesting person, not only at Olin, but also to job interviewers, and in life.\u000aPS. Do NaNoWriMo. It's awesome. And I know this cool app that helps you arrange your characters and plots: http://www.wriget.com/\u000aCheck it out.\u000a

aV\u000aHello OLINsiders! I'm Michael, a first year at this spectacular school, originally from a little town in Northeastern MA, interested in BioE, beekeeping, and doing my best in the Olin community. I found out about Olin online, but my visits were really what sealed the deal about this being the place for me.\u000aAnd so far, I haven't had any doubts about that feeling being right.\u000a\u000aFirst off, I can't believe it's only been four weeks. My classmates have become some of my best friends, and I feel like I've known them for years. We're already like a big happy family, and as cheesy as that sounds, it really is true. It's amazing being able to walk into the dining hall and just sit anywhere, because everyone would be happy to have you join in with their table.\u000aNext, the classwork has been totally true to how everyone described it. Lots of work, lots of projects, and lots of fun. No denying that Oliners earn their place on Princeton's #2 students study the most, but with Olin's do-learn model, the skill-building and creative thinking far outweigh any problem sets or busywork. The professors are also great at not overworking us or sending us in too deep over our heads, such as how in Modeling and Simulation they've already revamped the curriculum to make sure we really knew what was going on in our latest project. And of course, the Hoppers are getting into full swing.\u000a\u000aContinuing down the Olin Continuum, there is an incredible amount of opportunity to try new things and really follow up on current interests. I'm currently part of the Tango club (something I'd never have seen myself doing in high school), Beekeeping, Fiction with Admissions (a book club of sorts), TARDIS (the Doctor Who club), and Olin Volunteer Ambassadors League (meaning I might be giving tours to or hosting some of you fantastic Prospies), just to name a few, and am already starting some basic projects in one of the bio labs in my 'free time.'\u000aAnd just like how engineering here at Olin "begins and ends with people," life here begins and ends with Oliners. Between the guitar jams, Froyo runs, and a spectacular amount of puns, I've found a college beyond my wildest dreams. And despite any thoughts that this may be a bit, well...\u000a\u000a...I assure you, it's been all of that and more. (Disclaimer: I am still only four weeks in, and I'm not promising this for every Prospective student, but I'm certain that around this time next year some of you will be able to relate to my experiences thus far :) .)\u000atl;dr: This place is pretty fantastic.  \u000a\u000a~Michael, c/o 2017\u000a

aV\u000a So at this point I'm most of the way through my tour of Europe, and I'm currently staying in Rotterdam (just outside of Amsterdam). David '15 and I took a bike ride into the city center yesterday and found out that we happened to be in town the same day that Sinterclaas was arriving! Woo-hoo! Except that this Dutch version of Santa has a few twists.\u000aThere was a lit stage with a children's choir on the shore of a large river, and a crowd had gathered around. As we watched, he arrived in the harbor on a boat! The boat was flying the Spanish flag - Dutch tradition tells that he comes from Spain every year. It gets weirder, though. He wears a bishop's hat here. And all of his helpers are white, but have their faces painted to look like Africans. In America this would be termed racist but nobody seems to take offense to this.\u000aIn addition, the helpers hand out unwrapped candy to the kids in the crowd. Again, lawsuit material in America but apparently people don't habitually poison candy here. I had some (don't look at me like that, it was offered and I didn't take it from a little kid) and it was good if stale. Certainly not poisoned.\u000a\u000a\u000aSinterklaas is right in the middle there, getting off the boat\u000aSo Sinterklaas hangs out in Holland for a while I guess and the children get their presents on 5/12. (December the fifth. I've gotten into the habit of writing dates European-style.) I think it's a pretty cool tradition if you look past the possibly racially offensive part.I've enjoyed a few other cultural celebrations in Europe as well. David and I arrived in Barcelona just in time for the observance of La Merce, a huge citywide celebration in honor of their patron saint. Among other things, it involved giant statue parades, pyromusicals, and best of all, the Correfoc.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPictured: Giant statue parades, pyromusicals, and unimpressive photography skills\u000a\u000a\u000aTranslated literally, "Correfoc" means "fire run". It's a huge parade of people in devil costumes running down the street holding spinning sparklers. The sparklers are 10x the strength of the ones you'd find in America so they shoot sparks everywhere. Local teens like to form circles around the devils and dance under the raining sparks. And of course we joined in!\u000a\u000aThe sparks do hurt if they hit your skin so you have to cover up. They actually melted holes in my synthetic sweatshirt (I didn't have anything cotton to wear). But - need I say it? - this would again be lawsuit material in America. Someone would get a spark in the eye and sue. This is why we can't have cool celebrations like this back in the States.Dancing around with the Spanish teens, sparks raining down on me...the Correfoc was one of my best experiences in Europe so far.\u000aIf you want to see a short clip I took of the Correfoc:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ta7v5LqOs\u000aBasically, here's what I'm saying: Other cultures rule. I've enjoyed experiencing them. Try it sometime!\u000a\u000a< Derek >\u000a\u000a

aV\u000a Dear 2017'ers:\u000a\u000aHello there! :] I'm Emily, a rising sophomore at Olin. I hope you're all having wonderful summers thus far! It's hard to believe that it's already August - are you excited to begin your first year of college? If you (or your parental units) have started to ask about packing for college then you've come to the right place. Here's some guidelines on packing do's and don'ts:\u000a\u000aGeneral comments about packing:\u000a\u000a\u000aYou know yourself best, so if you want to bring something that's not mentioned, then you can figure out whether it'd be worthwhile to have it in your dorm room. \u000a\u000a\u000aOlin is not in the middle of nowhere - Target/Walmart/etc are nearby in Natick (~20min drive). Find a friend with a car (or if you have a car, invite friends who don't have cars :D!) to shop for items you didn't bring from home. \u000a\u000a\u000aNeedham also has a CVS, hardware store, and grocery stores (Volante Farms! Trader Joe's! Whole Foods! Roche Bros/Sudbury Farms!) that are easily accessed via bicycle (see note about GO bikes below) or car (5min drive).\u000a\u000a\u000aConsider how much you are able to pack - I'm from the west coast so I had to fit belongings in two suitcases and go shopping during the first week on campus, but my friends who drove to Olin had considerably more space in their vehicle.\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000aLess is more! You eventually have to pack up your room and put items in campus storage or take it back home at the end of the school year. Also you're probably going to accumulate more stuff via free swag from tech companies and other ventures. (The rule I heard was collect all the things you think you'll want. Pick half to take. -Victoria) \u000a\u000a\u000aRemember - you won't need winter clothes until winter time! Things that you find you'll want during the year can always be sent to Olin and picked up at the mailroom for your convenience. -V\u000a\u000a\u000aRemember to coordinate with your roommate so you don't bring doubles of things!! - Alex\u000a\u000a\u000aThings you want to bring from home or shop for when you arrive:\u000a\u000a\u000aFor you and your room\u000a\u000a\u000aBedsheets and blankets and pillows! - Olin mattresses are twin XL. \u000a\u000a\u000aMattress topper - If you choose to buy one, order this online and have it shipped to campus.\u000a\u000a\u000aExtra lighting - desk/room lamp for latenight studying/tinkering...\u000a\u000a\u000aDecorations! - soon Olin will become a home outside of home. Personalize your living space to your heart's content. Last year my roommate and I had a beach and ocean theme - with seashells and turtle lights and other items. \u000a\u000a\u000aPictures of family/pets/friends - guaranteed to help brighten your day and add a personal touch to your room setup. :-) \u000a\u000a\u000aSibb poster, turtle lights, pictures from home, and other ocean decorations dangling on the wall via command strip mini-hooks. :-)\u000a\u000a\u000aClothes - winter clothes don't need to be brought during the summer/fall, parents can send them or you can take them from home during Thanksgiving - Alex.\u000a\u000a\u000aFancy clothes! - for career fairs and end-of-semester EXPO presentations and other occasions!\u000a\u000a\u000aHangers\u000a\u000a\u000aCash - small bills and loose change are useful for splitting the bill for off-campus dinner or late-night pizza with friends. Venmo is also a handy app/website for reimbursing friends for purchases. \u000a\u000a\u000aLaundry basket/bag and detergent (The machines take quarters, but you can also put money on your Olin OneCard, a process that will be explained shortly after your arrival to Olin -Victoria)\u000a\u000a\u000aUtensils - spork, chopsticks, bowl, or plate - whatever you like to eat with when you or your friends decide to have a midnight kitchen adventure. \u000a\u000a\u000aSchool supplies - pencils, pens, notebooks, binders - choose whatever works best for your studying style. \u000a\u000a\u000aDry-erase markers - all of the rooms have mini-whiteboards next to the door. Optimal for writing messages or doodling.\u000a\u000aBackpack - to carry your laptop and circuit breadboards and projects. \u000a\u000aAlarm clock - you don't want to miss class! (or worse... skip breakfast)\u000a\u000a\u000aFirst-aid kit - you never know when this'll come in handy.\u000a\u000a\u000aZip lock bags, trash bags, and duct tape are just generally a good things to have for things that may come up - Alex\u000a\u000a\u000aFor your bathroom - coordinate this with your roommate!\u000a\u000a\u000aThin bathmat - there's not much clearance between the door and the shower floor; if the bathmat is too thick/fluffy you won't be able to close the door easily. \u000a\u000a\u000aShower caddy\u000a\u000a\u000aTowels - at least two (so when one of them is being washed you can use the other).\u000a\u000a\u000aCleaning supplies - beware of bathroom inspections at the end of semesters. Also, you can find toilet paper, paper towels, vacuums, and plungers in the trash/recycling rooms on each floor. - Alex\u000a\u000a\u000aMisc electronics for your room and/or Olin laptop (which you get during orientation):\u000a\u000a\u000aMouse - SolidWorks/CADing without a mouse can be painful. \u000a\u000a\u000aPower strip \u000a\u000a\u000aEthernet cable \u000a\u000a\u000aFlash drives!!!!! - Alex. Handy for things like backing up small amounts of files or an Ubuntu bootstick. :)\u000a\u000a\u000aExternal hard drive - not everybody has one but its a good idea just in case your computer dies. Additionally, some students get a docking station for their laptop so they can hook it up easily to a monitor/external drive. - Alex\u000a\u000a\u000aPhone and charger\u000a\u000a\u000aCamera and charger - to capture all the fun memories! ~pass no record~\u000a\u000a\u000aSpeakers/headphones - Olin laptop speakers aren't that great. If you're an audiophile or watch movies frequently you should consider bringing speakers or headphones. :]\u000a\u000a\u000aLAPTOP STICKERS!!!! all Olin laptops are identical. Put some swag on yours so you can identify it. - Alex \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEmily: Alternatively, buy a whiteboard laptop sticker and doodle on it. :-) Also useful for quick project sketches and problem solving. \u000a\u000aThings you might want but aren't necessary: \u000a\u000aFor your room\u000a\u000a\u000aTall mirror - There's a small mirror in the bathroom but a tall mirror is convenient for overall outfit checks (i.e. situations that call for fancy clothes).\u000a\u000a\u000aAdditional seating (foldable chair or mini-couch) - if you have the space for it. Optimal for when friends come to hang out and watch a movie in your room.\u000a\u000a\u000aCommand strips/hooks - convenient for hanging up posters and coats, be careful to make sure they don't peel off wall paint.\u000a\u000a\u000aExtra shelves - The room comes with shelf sets already, but some students like having more compartments to organize stuff. I suggest waiting until you move in before buying new furniture. \u000a\u000a\u000aStep stool - Olin beds are usually raised fairly high; step stools are convenient if you're not the world's best at jumping into bed. (Speaking of beds with height, here's a link to lofting guidelines if you're interested.) \u000a\u000a\u000aShower curtain - the shower comes with its own curtain but it's fun to bring your own to personalize your bathroom. :] \u000a\u000a\u000aHobby items - frisbee, your favorite board game, baking supplies (the kitchen usually has a lot of equipment but if you bake often you might want to bring your own set), cards, etc. for a fun study break with friends! The ball room in west hall also has a bunch of sports items. \u000a\u000a\u000aMore electronics\u000a\u000a\u000aProjector/Monitor - convenient for spontaneous movie nights in your room! Projectors can also be borrowed from the IT department for short periods of time.\u000a\u000a\u000aVideo games - Pokemon nostalgia study break? ;D\u000a\u000a\u000aMany people also bring their video game consoles to leave in the lounges for others to play. - Alex \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWater boiler / rice cooker - The room already comes equipped with a microwave/minifridge/freezer, and there are appliances in the dorm kitchen on the first floor. It's best to use these in the kitchen to prevent fire alarm mishaps. Stay safe!\u000a\u000a\u000aOther\u000a\u000a\u000aInstruments!! - there are many ways to continue music activities at Olin (shameless plugs for Olin Conductorless Orchestra (OCO)! Olin Rock Orchestra (ORO) and other combos are pretty fun too.). Spontaneous jam sessions are highly encouraged.\u000a\u000a\u000aIron: There are irons in the laundry room in case you need to smoothen out your spiffy shirts and the like. Depending on how often you iron your clothes it may or may not be useful to have your own. :-) \u000a\u000a\u000aBikes! - there are GO (Greening Olin) bikes in the east hall bike room which are convenient for trips to Needham/Wellesley/etc and open to anyone to use, so don't stress out about buying a new bike for college. However, if you're a hardcore biker and/or know you'll be biking really often, it might be worth bringing your bicycle and storing it on campus.\u000a\u000a\u000aTent/sleeping bag - Alex reminded me about the annual camping trips organized by the Olin Outing club. Highly recommended for a fun weekend in nature and meeting upperclassmen! I believe it's scheduled for the first weekend after classes start in September.\u000a\u000a\u000aThings you probably do not need to bring:\u000a\u000aPrinter/scanner - Olin is sprinkled with printers and scanners throughout campus that students can use for free. \u000a\u000a\u000aWireless router - Students are not allowed to set up their own wireless networks in the dorms. It tends to make the dorm wifi sporadic and is rage-inducing (ask any sophomore about the cube).\u000a\u000a\u000aAnother computer - Unless you're a super hardcore gamer, don't bring your desktop. Your Olin student laptop should be more than enough to keep you occupied. \u000a\u000a\u000aPeople do bring other laptops if they prefer macs or just want to have another laptop around, but it is required that you buy your Olin laptop. -Alex\u000a\u000a\u000aFridge, microwave, or freezer -they come with the dorms!! - Alex\u000a\u000a\u000aTV: Most people who have a telly in their room say it just occupies space. The lounges have TVs which work well for video games, movie nights, or watching shows with friends.\u000a\u000a\u000aHot plate - The fire alarms at Olin are fairly sensitive; we encourage all cooking adventures to happen in the first floor student kitchen, not in your rooms.\u000a\u000a\u000aClothes you never wear - This speaks for itself, I think.\u000a\u000a\u000aReference Books/Textbooks/Materials from relevant high school classes - Your call on this one. One of my best friends brought the Feynman Lectures on Physics textbooks (because he's a Physics:E) . Most people didn't need highschoolera materials for Olin classes. I would wait to ship these from home if absolutely necessary.\u000a\u000a\u000aBooks you rarely read - The Needham and Wellesley libraries are easily a bike ride away if you can't find a book of interest in the college library.\u000a\u000a\u000aPets - technically only fish are allowed as pets in the dorms. :\u005c\u000a\u000a\u000aCraigslist/Street furniture - the student handbook says ": In an effort to avoid the health and financial issues associated with a bedbug or other pest infestation, the College prohibits upholstered furniture from unaccountable places such as craigslist, town dumps and second-hand shops. New furniture and furniture of confirmed quality (e.g., from family or close friends) is acceptable". Stay safe with your extra seating!\u000a\u000a\u000aMore information on dorm rules can be found in appendix C of the student handbook. You'll get a copy of the most recent version when you arrive on campus. :-)\u000a\u000aWell, I believe that's all I have to say for now about packing for west hall. Hopefully that helped a bit with your preparations for arrival day! Feel free to email me (emily [dot] wang [at] students [dot] olin [dot] edu) or make a post in the class Facebook group with any questions/comments/concerns. Your sibb, parent volunteers, and Nick Tatar (the assistant dean of student life) are also great resources for move-in advice.\u000a\u000aMajor thanks to Victoria Preston ('2016, WH1 resident resource) and Alex Crease ('2016, robotics and pun engineer) for the helpful comments and catching things that I forgot to mention. :-)\u000a\u000aFinally, best of luck with the rest of your summer adventures and preparations! See you soon on campus (and be sure to talk to upperclassmen! we're all super excited to meet you in September). Thanks again for reading! c:\u000a\u000a-Emily Wang ('2016)\u000a

aV\u000aGreetings, Olinsiders!\u000aMichael '17 here, giving you the latest scoop on one of the most engaging, phenomenal (and possibly my personal favorite) topics on campus: Bio:E! Our first chance to declare a major is coming up soon(ish), and I'll be as quick to declare mine as I was to accept Olin's offer: Engineering with Bioengineering. \u000a\u000aBut before I tell you all the amazing things you can do as a bioengineer at Olin, a note to the Candidates of 2014: You got this! Only a fewmillenia days left.Try not to stress out too much (pot telling the kettle), and no matter what happens, you're going to be great! And if you'd enjoy a particularly interesting acceptance story, allow me to redirect you to fellow blogger William Saulnier's postfrom this time last year. (My path was much more straightforward, with a lot of jumping up and down and general excitement.)\u000aAnd now, a return to our regularly scheduled programming. Despite being a bit smaller than some of Olin's other programs, our Bioengineering track (affectionately termed Squish:E, among other program nicknames such as Spark:E, Soft:E, Rust:E/Crank:E, Des:E...) has a lot going on.\u000a\u000aNot quite.\u000aAside from working with some really fantastic students and faculty (which I'm sure you can find in all areas of Olin studies), being a Bio:E at Olin offers a few more specific perks:\u000aResearch! While all sorts of research is available at Olin, the Bio:E area is especially plentiful. When looking at the summer packet, I was elated about how many Bio:E's (or students doing bio-flavored research) will be at Olin this summer. And even as a first-year, research is never hard to find. Interested in microbial systems? Talk to Professor Jean Huang, who does research in microbial diversity and photosynthetic bacteria. Cancer and immunology? Professor Joanne Pratt is researchinggrowth and functional programs of white blood cells. Tissue or cellular engineering? Professor Alisha Sarang-Sieminski specializes in cell mechanics and tissue engineering.\u000aThe field itself! Bioengineering is absolutely exploding, and its current potential is limitless. According to the BLS, Biomedical Engineering is the fastest growing engineering field, and are so many incredible discoveries being made and applications being found. From prosthetics to petroleum-replacements to pharmaceuticals, doors are open in every direction.\u000aCourses! Between Olin, Wellesley, and Babson, there is a plethora of amazing biology and bioengineering courses that you can pick to suit your interests. A few of Olin's offerings: Tissue Engineering, Microbial Diversity, Emerging Technologies in Cancer Research and Treatment, and StructuralBiomaterials. Plus, the additional benefit of avoiding most course registration competition.\u000aWhether or not you've been swayed...\u000a\u000aI hope I've at least convinced you to give E:Bio a glance, and see if it works for you. And ultimately that's what everything at Olin is about: finding your fit, and blazing a trail right down the intersection of your passions and where the world needs you.\u000aAnd again, 2014 Candidates: Envelope big or small, USPS or UPS, you've made it this far and I'm fully confident in your ability to change the world for the better. Go out there and rock it!\u000a~Michael, c/o '17\u000a

aV\u000a By Jessi Murray, 2010\u000aI didn't blog much this semester, as you may have noticed. I've been one of the writers for this little project since my freshman year-- now three years ago. I knew I should be writing more posts. I took pictures for them, I wrote them, one I even published before taking down later (for NDA reasons). I guess what stopped me from writing a lot of the time was the fact that, despite getting lovely GPA-raising grades this semester, this was one of the toughest I've experienced on a personal level possibly ever.\u000aI didn't want these feelings to come through on a blog that is supposed to attract prospective students. I didn't want to be the person who was a poor reflection of the school. However, these situations are reality, and from them some positive things did stem.\u000a(Even if you don't care about this post, you should click through for an awesome video of a bunch of Olin students doing the Thriller dance.)\u000a        I did have a lot of fun at times this semester. I did Thrill the World (led by blogger Tiama '11):\u000aI learned how to make pickles and jams from the new Biology professor. I got to help my fellow students (or at least supply them with candy and other food) as an R2 (Olin's version of an RA).Still, things were tough. I was sick a great deal from a new medication. I was worried about job prospects. There scads of other things all on my mind. Frankly, worrying can be common here.It's not anything particular to Olin- just particular to the sorts of high-achievers that come here. What's also not particular is the silence that often accompanies any sort of struggle. There is a self-induced stigma; none of your peers would judge you, but you don't want them to know anyway. For a long time, I assumed all of my friends had 4.0 GPAs. They don't.What helped me get through this, what stopped me from taking a medical leave of absence, were my friends. My friends held my hair back as I vomited, handed me tissues when I just needed a good cry, and sat on my couch for hours just talking. When I think about all of the schools that I could have gone to, the what-ifs always disappear when I think about the friends I've made here. These are the friends I'll have for life.

aVWake up at 9 am, watch some soccer on the projector, have breakfast, head on over to Admissions to talk with some parents at this weekend's Open House, do a bit of reading, ride my scooter to the Starbucks in Wellesley for an afternoon snack, write a blog post, have dinner, play some pool, do a bit more reading, go to bed.

aVThat's how today will look and I'm hoping the next six weeks will look very similar to it. You might recall in my last post way back at the start of the semester that I am (or was) taking several half-semester courses at once this semester. The plan was to front-load them and leave the second half of the semester free to work on personal projects (i.e. research, passionate pursuits, etc.). Well, that was a great plan, except I hadn't anticipated just how much work three half-semester courses (on top of three regular courses) would involve. The last two weeks have undoubtedly been the most stressful of my college career thus far, so if you only take one thing away from this blog post:

aVWe've just crossed the half-way point of the semester, so my schedule is undergoing a radical weight-loss program. ProbStat, LinAlg, and Relativity are gone. Six Books that Changed the World has turned into Science Fiction & Historical Context. There are new things, too! I'll be spending the rest of the academic year working with the folks in Communications, something that I'm hoping will give my design-orientated self some much needed experience. I'll be continuing my research from the summer in the hopes that I am accepted to a conference in Hawaii in April. I'll also be taking a Passionate Pursuit in Ney playing at a Turkish Cultural Center in Brookline.

aVBut for now I'm loving the much-needed break from work. I actually need it - my immune system has gone on vacation and left me with a cold - but having unstructured time is something that we really do need to put greater value on. Not having to rush from one meeting to another and just

aVlife is a feeling I've missed for the past four or five weeks. I spent a couple weekends out of town to do some fun things with my family, but in the back of my mind I was always worrying about the work I would have to finish when I got back. To me it highlights that just because we are capable of pushing ourselves extraordinarily hard as students doesn't necessarily make it a good idea.

aV\u000a        I got an email from my dad today. He was expressing relief after checking hiscalendarthat Candidate's Weekend was next weekend, and that nocandidatewould have to sludge through the potential two to three feet of snow that soon will be blanketing the campus. I'd have to agree. Everyone should be able to get here on time with minimal delay, and with a few thousand flights already canceled in and out of the east coast, it would have been quite a feat of engineering (get it?) to have everyone here for such an exciting weekend.\u000a\u000aIt's exciting for me, because it's been about a year since I was invited to Candidate's Weekend, arriving on campus, meeting my now classmates, talking with now upperclassmen, design building, interviewing, and breathing Olin. No other school does this (as far as I know). To most, I felt like I was an entry in a database, but at Candidate's weekend I was a living, breathing person, more then any test score or grade can describe.\u000a        I think that is what's most empowering about Candidate's Weekend. It gives you the chance to show what words and numbers cannot, to fly free as thephoenix(I need to stop now) and be reborn anew. It is as much an assessment of your qualities at it is an assessment of the college's qualities. Some people come to candidate's weekend and find they don't enjoy it as much as they thought they would. Candidate's Weekend is very much an organic event. The people you'll be talking to are not scripted, are not told what to say and what not to say. There is no list of banned topics, no question too strange or too taboo. Talk to any Olin student and they will tell you everything you'd want to know, the fabulous and what needs to be improved. If you end up not enjoying your time, the challenges that you face, or the people that you meet, then I feel Candidate's Weekend was a success.\u000a\u000aSee, this whole college process is about finding the right fit for you. It's about visiting, exploring, listening, and feeling out the quirks of each campus and each student body in turn. When I stepped on Olin's campus, I was curious and ready to explore, and I was rewarded with an amazing group of people with whom I could relate too. It reminded me of my days at CTY in Lancaster, where I spent 4 summers working with amazing people whom I still stay in contact with to this very day. Heck, even one of my former hall mates, one whom I had known over three years, is attending Olin with me! The long and short of it was, I had never felt at home in such a place before CTY, and I got the same feeling from Olin as well. That's how I knew it was a good fit for me.\u000a\u000aThis is starting to drag on a bit, and there is plenty of snow to be had, so I will leave you with my list of things every candidate should do when they are at their candidate's weekend.\u000a\u000a\u000aExplore everything.\u000aTalk with people.\u000aGo to all the events.\u000aTalk with more people.\u000aPlay dodgeball.\u000aTalk with more and more people.\u000aHang out in rooms in the BECC until two in the morning.\u000aDrink all the free soda and eat all the free snacks.\u000aVisit every table in the Career fair.\u000aTALK. TO. EVERYBODY.\u000aDon't be afraid to ask questions.\u000aDon't be afraid ofspontaneity.\u000aHave Fun.\u000a\u000a

aV\u000a        It is truly a beautiful moment when uncertainties, possibilities, and individual efforts come together into a single, vibrant entity. Such was the moment when I sat down with 40 other Olin students and faculty to enjoy a locally-sourced, vegan dinner that had been about a month in the making. As co-presidents of Grow: Olin's Sustainability Group, James ('12) and I had envisioned this Fall Harvest Banquet as an enjoyable event, infused with many of the group's ideas about holistic sustainability.\u000aGrow was created last Fall in an attempt to bring more unity to the many sustainability efforts on Olin's campus. Previous sustainability-related student groups had fizzled out as their leadership graduated from Olin, and we wanted to create a strong body that would provide support and continuity to the ecosystem of projects, courses, and events in this broad area. Grow's first year has seen a number of successes (which I will certainly write more about in a later post), and the Harvest Banquet was one of the most ambitious events we have put on to date.\u000a        In my ongoing search for insight into the root causes of\u000a(un)sustainability, I came across the following definition proposed by\u000aJohn Ehrenfeld in Sustainability by Design: "Sustainability is the possibility that humans and other life will flourish\u000a on Earth forever." Flourish has a very different meaning than "survive"\u000a or "exist," and it communicates the necessity to address social,\u000acultural, and ethical well-being as inextricably linked to environmental\u000a well-being.\u000aThis is the definition of sustainability that inspired our Fall Harvest\u000aBanquet. Through purchasing our produce directly from local organic\u000afarmers, we were more directly connected to the growing process and\u000aaware of its environmental impact. Through choosing to make the entire\u000ameal free of animal products, we brought up many of the ethical\u000aquestions relating to the U.S. food industry. Through bringing our\u000acommunity together to cook and eat mindfully, we were further connected\u000ato the wonderful people surrounding us.\u000aSeeing the many smiling faces around me, the exhaustion from\u000a12 hours of continuous cooking vanished and was replaced with deep\u000agratitude. There were many moments in the previous weeks when I had\u000adoubted that everything would come together, but Olin students, faculty,\u000a and staff generously donated their time and energy to make our vision a\u000a reality: they biked over 30 pounds of produce from Boston to Olin, set\u000aup a warmly-lit corner of the Academic Center to seat 40 people, let us\u000ause the Olin kitchen to cook a cauldron of stew and massive trays of\u000aroasted vegetables, ran around campus in search of plants and vases for\u000adecoration, set up a record player and speakers to play some excellent\u000amusic...\u000aSurrounded by these people and delighting in the meal, I thought to myself: "This is flourishing."\u000aThe corner of the Academic Center we converted to serve as a dining room for 40 people, awaiting our guests\u000a\u000aEnjoying the meal, music, and friends.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLoading up a plate of organic salads, Tabbouleh, grilled vegetables, freshly baked bread, sweet potato biscuits...\u000a

aV\u000aI don't think I've ever gotten around to actually talking about what I do on a regular basis. This weekend was particularly fun:\u000aFriday:\u000aDinner with all of the women who do Bio Research at Joanne Pratt's (bio professor) house, with Russian food organized by Kate!\u000aSeeing 21 with friends\u000aDropping in at Casino Night hosted by SAC- a new event this year with real dealers and ipods to win!\u000aOff to MIT to see new friends over there during CPW- including meeting their Prefrosh\u000aSaturday:\u000aStudying for Sig Sys Test\u000aEnjoying the nice weather!\u000aVisiting MIT to "celebrate" a friends' anniversary- of when they met at CPW\u000aSunday:\u000aStudying more for Sig Sys\u000aSig Sys Test\u000aHomework/Dinner at Panera with a friend\u000aMore homework\u000aDesign meeting\u000aMeeting for LOA next year!!!!!\u000aTo do list stuff.\u000aSaturday was also supposed to be populated by an exciting visit out to see a friend at Clark- but that never materialized. On the upside I got to study more as a result, and I think my test went pretty well.\u000aSo moving on- LOA!! LOA= Leave of Absence= I won't be on campus next semester.  Nor will I be graduating on time. (This makes me wonder, how old will the average holder of a 2011 diploma be? between deferred years and LOAs, I estimate quite high).\u000aRegardless, myself, and 5 friends have put a deposit down on a house to lease for next year.  We'll be living there and pursuing our own interests, projects, and businesses, rather than having another year of class immediately.  It will hopefully help us to refocus what we're interested in and what we want to be moving towards with out final two years.\u000aIt wasn't an easy decision to pursue- it means a year of uncertainty and risk, and not graduating with our class.  However, I think it will be worthwhile on the whole. Here's where you come in- I have tons of ideas on what to pursue, but I'm always open to more. Have ideas for what I should do on my LOA? Let me know!\u000a-Ellen\u000a

aV\u000aI just wanted to take the time to assure our avid readers that the Olin student bloggers - and the rest of the student body - is still alive and well! Unfortunately, a happy Oliner is a busy Oliner, which often means we fail horribly at keeping our blogs up-to-date. I, for example, still have 150 pages of Uncle Tom's Cabin to read, half a Relativity problem set, some Linear Algebra, and some German to finish before tomorrow. But I decided while I'm sitting in this lovely Wellesley coffee shop on this lovely autumn afternoon, I should take the time to catch you all up on the start of a new semester.\u000a\u000aWith regards to my summer research, we finished out abstract and submitted it to the conference organizers in early August. They will let us know if we are accepted to the conference sometime in November, but we will still write a formal paper regardless. I won't be working on it much until late October because of my course schedule.\u000a\u000aI am taking Linear Algebra, Probability & Statistics, Relativity, Six Books that Changed the World, Science Fiction & Historical Context, Dynamics, and German (at Wellesley College!). It's a long list, but it's only 18 credits since the first 5 courses are all only half a semester. I am front-loading my semester so that whilst the first six weeks are going to be (and already are) exceptionally busy, it will leave the second-half almost entirely empty. And it's during that time that I can commit myself to my research, myextracurriculars, and of course this blog.\u000a\u000aAnyway, time to get back to work. Until next time!\u000a\u000a-B\u000a

aVThat's right; I'm halfway done with Olin. I really cannot believe it [and yes, every time I say it I freak out a little bit]. I feel like so much has happened in such a short amount of time, from the projects I've worked on, to the friendships I've made. Because of the hecticness of finals, I didn't get the chance to write, so I'll do my best to summarize some recent events here.

aV\u000aWow. It's December 15. Perhaps more astounding than the fact I leave in 5 days is that I've been here for 106 days. That's a lot. Doesn't seem like it though... It's been a remarkable semester for me. I've learned a lot, although only a part of it has been academic. I think for the first time in my life I reached the limit of what I can handle at once - six classes at Carnegie Mellon is definitely not the same experience as six classes at Olin. My plan of "take all the classes at the start of the semester, enjoy relaxing second half of the semester" definitely did not work out since that much course work was more than I bargained for, but then I got involved in so many extracurricular activities that the second half wasn't exactly the vacation I thought it would be.\u000a\u000aStill, I don't think I'd have it any other way. It's made me realize that getting involved in more things doesn't equate to getting more done and that sometimes you have to be able to say "no" to something, no matter how much it interests you. I've decided to go down the Engineering with Design route instead ofMechanicalEngineering, so my list of extracurricular activities for next semester is actually longer than my course schedule. I've run out of prior experience to work from and am having to move forwards into the unknown, learning as I go along. Perhaps most note-worthy is that I am exactly half-way through my undergraduate studies.\u000a\u000aSo it's been an eventful semester - literally! I've been to Petit Le Mans, got into Boston a bunch of times, participated in the President's Council, multiple I2E2 events, I saw my girlfriend graduate from college last weekend, and I'm going to New York next weekend for the OCO Concert. Next semester will have a high bar to beat, but knowing Olin, I think it's going to more than deliver. \u000a

aV\u000aIt's Thanksgiving break and I'm back in New York for the third year in a row! It's a tradition now to come to NYC every time now I guess.\u000a\u000aThis time, I'm visiting with Andrea ('13) and lucky for us, her cousin who lives in Brooklyn has left for the week and has graciously allowed us to stay in her apartment! It feels really cool living in a New York apartment and getting a 20-min subway trip into the city center.\u000a\u000aOur goal this break is to see all the Broadway shows we can (without going bankrupt...)\u000aFirst up, we watched Daniel Radcliffe (that's right, real-life Harry Potter himself) in the musical "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying". It was awesome to see Radcliffe just 6 seats in front of us on stage! At the end of the show, he auctioned off the bowtie he was wearing all evening to raise money for the AIDS/HIV initiative that Broadway is supporting; he earned a few thousand $$'s in the space of 10 minutes. Impressive and for a good cause too.\u000a\u000aNext was the musical Billy Elliot with some fantastic kid actors and dancers doing ballet and tap. It was a phenomenal play. The most amazing thing to me on Broadway is watching the magical and seamless movement of actors and sets that circulate the whole time around. One second you are watching a scene in a mining plant in the middle of no-where and the next you get transported into a ballet school. \u000a\u000a\u000aAnd hopefully tonight or tomorrow we're off to see Rent! with Rachel ('13) and her family. I'm very excited.\u000aSometime in the week we hope to get to the Lion King or The Book of Mormon (it's sold out all the time), but it's been raved about.\u000a\u000aAnd as a plus, being in New York means seeing some movie shootings too. We walked through a movie set with Olivia Wilde and Jason Bateman yesterday a block away from the apartment. Apparently it was a 'low-budget film shooting' ... yeah, right. We got to see both actors just a few feet in front of us!\u000a\u000aSo that's New York so far. Dugger ('13) and Matt('12) are just arriving to crash with us too, and Thanksgiving is soon coming up =) \u000a\u000a\u000a(Below is a picture of Andrea and I with a poster in front of the Daniel Radcliffe show.)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aPerfectly enough, the entry about balance and keeping track of work and play at Olin is the one I started, but got too busy/ distracted to finish. Here it is now, out of order and throwing us off balance (pad-am-ching!)\u000aI think the basic problem is not unique to Olin, but is something everyone faces upon experiencing a major change in life -- like say, going away to college. All of a sudden, there's all this freedom, all these new opportunities to get involved, to socialise -- and yes, all this new work to get done. How this works out at Olin, I think is a function of the kind of person Olin attracts in terms of how proactive and passionate "the average Oliner" is. You'd think that since it's a smaller school there would be fewer things to get involved in. Not true at all. There's the usual, and more.\u000a        \u000aIt takes something different for each person to find the point at which they feel happy about what they're getting done as compared to how much fun they are having, and how much sleep they're getting. I have to admit, it took me at least one solid year to find this point for myself, and I don't really know that I can articulate exactly what it took.\u000aFor one, when I make decisions on what I want to do, I now operate on more of an "excellence voting" system, rather than an "approval voting" system. This means that I (generally) stay away from signing up for things I know I'll only be able to do a mediocre job with, which leaves me much more satisfied. I was part of an Olin team in some thing called the Federal Reserve Challenge at the college level last fall, and still feel a little queasy about having to trade that in for things like CORe and the show this year. That whole saying "no" thing is still going to take some practice.\u000aOn a related note, the whole picture bandwagon looks like too much fun to miss out on! This past weekend, a bunch of us attended an intercollegiate figure skating competition at BU to watch the fabulous Olin College Figure Skating Team kick some serious backside.\u000a\u000aCarmelle representing Olin at the BU Intercollegiate Figure Skating Competition, '07\u000aSure, the team is a one woman (Carmelle Tsai, '08) show right now, but I think that so perfectly demonstrates my point about the kind of person Olin attracts -- she's been skating for years now, and wanted to keep doing it at Olin. So she does, despite the fact that we have no skating rink, or established skating team/ program.Rumour has it that Olin was conceived during a conversation between Larry Milas (then President of the F. W. Olin Foundation), and his wife that ended with "Why don't you start your own damn college?"\u000aOwn damn college, own damn figure skating team, keep it coming!\u000aReally looking forward to meeting some of you at Candidate's Weekend!\u000a- Meena\u000a

aV\u000a        By Jessi Murray '10\u000aI'm a senior. We seniors do a lot of things-- we work on SCOPE, we avoid SCOPE, we reminisce about our faraway days as freshmen. Most of all, though, we try to figure out what the heck is going on after graduation. In that way, we've almost reverted back to our high school days. Sending in applications, meeting for interviews, and trying to make big decisions without really knowing what we're doing.\u000aI'm proud to say, though, that I know what I'm doing. Starting this July, I'll be working as a Program Manager for Microsoft in the Windows division. \u000a        Microsoft recently decided (at least in part due to the success of past Olin grads there) that they really wanted more Olin students. Why? Because Olin's curriculum actually prepares you incredibly well for the Program Manager role. It has been often noted that Olin students enter jobs after graduation and perform as though they had 3-5 years of experience. Essentially, you're getting 4 years of experience while here.\u000aOlin's curriculum definitely does have its flaws; sometimes theory is glossed over in favor of practical applications, and we don't have as much depth as a larger institution. For that reason, those who are aiming to go into research and academia often have to push a little bit harder to get that background (though they are usually pretty successful at it). For industry's purposes, though, Olin has really made me an incredibly strong applicant. \u000aI've worked on academic teams (including across disciplines and colleges) for the past 4 years, building up communication skills. I've been taught how to really embrace user-centered design. You learn how to learn here, and you learn how to fly by the seat of your pants successfully. I think an excellent adjective for an average Olin student would be "scrappy." And, certainly, Olin's name getting me an IBM internship last year didn't hurt when it came time to look at my resume. \u000aIt's nice to feel like my gamble paid off. I turned down a lot of big name schools, including that one with the dome in Cambridge. For a while freshman year, I was convinced that I had really messed up. I don't think that anymore.\u000aFor now, I get to relax, look for apartments in Seattle, and get as much time in with my puppy back at the family home before I move. It's been a crazy 4 years, but I think it's going to be a crazy next few as well.\u000a

p2146
aVdrills drilling and sanders sanding and students looking befuddled (and
p2147
aVoccasionally frustrated). We started this project for Design Nature at the very
p2148
aVbeginning of the semester, went through the entire design process, and when it
p2149
aVcame to the very end, my hopper didn't work. 
p2150
aVBut I finished constructing it nonetheless, and was actually
p2151
aVsatisfied. First semester of freshman year is graded Pass/No Record, so that we
p2152

p2153
aVallowing us to try different study styles, and try to do crazy things for
p2154
aVprojects, with much less inhibition. Because we don't have to worry about
p2155
aVgrades, we can focus on learning and trying out things that may or may not
p2156
aVwork. So even though my hopper just twitched on the table instead of
p2157
aVsomersaulting in the air like I had hoped, I was pretty proud of my efforts. I
p2158
aVlearned a ton, especially about how to effectively and efficiently use the

p2160

aVAgain, this is\u000ajust a basic list of Oliners' suggestions to get you started. Nothing is law.\u000aMost people recommend doing most of your shopping once you arrive, or ordering\u000aonline and shipping large things to Olin. Some stores will allow you to\u000apurchase items where you live now and pick them up at a store close to Olin.\u000aThere will be some time when you move in (not a ton, though) to go to the\u000astore. The Natick mall is HUGE, and Target does exist in Massachusetts.\u000aEverybody does things differently, though. I drove to school, so we got everything\u000aahead of time and took it with us. It's really a matter of personal preference.
p2196
aVTalk to your\u000aroommate before you buy big things! It's not a bad idea to get settled for a\u000aweek or two, then go out to get anything you think you might want. Less is more\u000awhen it comes to moving.

aV\u000aI am the type of exhausted that only 2 hours of soccer in light French rain with swarthy French college students on a gravel soccer pitch can make you feel. I'm the type of well-fed that only a customary 9 o'clock 3.5 course French dinner with salad, plat principal, cheese, and after dinner tea, can make you feel. In fact, I'm getting the proportions of mind blowing and entertaining that only a study away overseas in a foreign language can give you.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a            Do you ever have one of those days where everything swings into stride? You awake after a tidy 7.5 hour sleep to French talk radio announcing that this weekend will be the first sunny one since you arrived nearly 2 weeks ago. Just enough time to pack a lunch of leftovers from last night's dinner cooked with friends, banter a bit with your house mother and the maid who comes on Mondays, and forget to pick the things up off your floor (again) as you dash out the back gate of the garden to catch the bus. You know the stops well enough now to read on the way towards the first real class of the semester, only pausing to hit the "Arrete demande" button, deftly sweeping out from between the hissing rear bus doors to be greeted by the leering Johnny Depp, wiping what is presumably blood from a barber's razor. "Le Diabolique Barbier de Fleet Street" posters have just arrived for the upcoming release of a film that has doubtlessly been playing in the U.S. for a couple weeks. No time for Sondheim music or cannabalism now because your French grammar professor has this charming way of chewing out people who cross her, and your thusfar successful attempts to laugh off her criticism would best be saved for later.\u000aThe Peugots and Citroens seem to hurry themselves out of your way, not wanting to break your stride across the few streets you  cross en route to your class in the centre ville. Class is smooth and no homework given, since although not exactly a university your study abroad program is decidedly european and this mean the teachers don't tell you precisely what to do for their course. We're told that European professors see their job as being to deliver a course. Not hold discussions, or assign and correct homework. They deliver info, you absorb and practice etc and then you deliver on your controle or exam at the mid or end of term.  None of this bothers you in the least- you haven't even committed to courses yet and you'll be showing up to as many as you feel like before coming to a decision in the week to come.\u000aAfter reheated (and cheap!) lunch in the little dining room with your fellow study abroad Americans, chatting in broken French about the successful soirees of the weekend, you ally with a group in search of sports. The street-car-esque Tramway seems to find you, and you happen to stand in the exact spot where the door comes to rest, opening with a conviviality that only efficient public transportation can offer. Arriving at the University of Nantes, the land of French speaking classmates to come, you and your foreign friends make the pleasant discovery that registering to participate in sports in groups of 2 saves you each about 18 euro. Super chouette! That's more than a week of lunches, or a pretty good night out on the town. You get yet another goofy ID photo taken and receive yet another plastic card covered with some combination of trivial identifying factoids and your face. Register for soccer? Great! Register for a capoeira class? Why not? What better place than France to learn a Brazilian martial art?\u000aParting with your American friends, the crowd seem to part as you decide that you may as well pass the time before soccer by attending an astrophysics course at the nearby Faculte de Sciences, which who knows, you might like to take. Finding it before it starts is the real trick, but between a simple conversation with the bonhomme at the Centre d'Acceuil and running into a fellow student looking for the very same class, things continue to fall into place. With the international power of two, no lecture room can remain unfound.\u000aThe prof arrives some minutes late, and you get to hear your first ever scientific lecture in  French.  Surprising, the vocab is relatively  easy to pick up since technical terms seem to be specific by nature.  It's the names of common symbols and mathematical expressions that you later decide to find a reference for, since those are concepts not being written out and explained, not even in your second language for the understanding of a cultural reference you're only beginning to wrap your mind around. Turns out you learned most of the content of this course in the one week crash course in astrophysics for your NASA summer internship 2 years ago. Bof. Well, there are more science courses.\u000aYou're the first one out of the lecture hall and the Tram pulls up just as you approach to return you 2 stops to the soccer pitch. 90 minutes and some dozen 7on7 matches later, you're back on the bus towards your delightful host family home just outside the coeur de ville. Nantes is looking like a pretty decent city. And with only a few hours by TGV high speed train to Paris, and something like 3 weeks of break between now and May, the choices are looking pretty wide open.\u000aTonight, you'll sleep heavily and well. Maybe in another few weeks you'll hit the true language threshold... and start dreaming in French.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAbove: At the height of French communication technology.\u000a\u000aBelow: At the height of French 17th century architecture.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

From the looks of the room, there is some real creativity going on the room is getting messier as we progress further into Monday.\u000a\u000aWhy are so many first-years working passionately through their sleeping hours? Tomorrow, amid the end of classes and looming finals, a very ruthless bunch of individuals will converge on Olin. That's right, a class of 4th graders are coming to review swimmers, the final project of Design Nature.\u000a        \u000aDesign Nature, part of what is now dubbed the "Olin Introductory Experience," is described as a "focus is on the general principles and methods\u000athat shape the practice of engineering design." Design Nature goes through this process by designing two bio-inspired devices. The first device is the hopper, a self-powered, plastic (Delrin, to be specific) jumping toy that must trigger and jump by itself after being placed on a flat surface. The second device is our beloved swimmer. Swimmers, which have replaced Climbers as the end-of-term Design Nature project, are built in small teams of 3-5 people. They must meet the needs of the stakeholders, which in this case are the parties concerned with children's toys. (Parents, kids, manufacturers) Teams may bring in outside supplies, up to a limit of $50 value, and this project consumes the last 10 weeks of class time. Along the way we learn project scheduling, budgeting, team dynamics, different design approaches, technical knowledge (depending on your design), and all the juicy gossip on our team members**.\u000a\u000aPhelpinators motion proposal diagram, part of the concept review stage of swimmer design.\u000a\u000aWhere are we in the design process? Project time-lines (this one courtesy of Rock Lobster) are required, though they won't stop the creative **cough-procrastination-cough** juices from concentrating near the end of the project. Don't worry Rock Hoppers, I'm not accusing you.\u000a\u000aWill it swim? Jacqui and Charlie take their Nautilus for a dip.\u000aWe haven't made it to demo day yet. We are at about t minus 8 hours. Things are getting pretty crazy. I've heard more references to internet memes than is healthy. Some teams are getting into the spirit of their projects, like the hippo team which is kindly serenading us with I want a hippopotamus for Christmas on infinite loop. Others seem to being doing pre-tests of their swimmers by reducing the effective age though chair surfing and other raucous horseplay. The Wellesley Domino's delivery dude is probably glad we passed their closing hour. I have seen many, sporadic orders of Alex Davis Specials come through. I am confident, however, that we will make it though the night, have (mostly) swimming toys, final SolidWorks models, and maybe even some PR propaganda.\u000aSwimmers are... to be continued.\u000aColin\u000a*Less on the fabrication side, unless you consider first-years to be the manufacturer.\u000a**That last one might not be a learning goal.\u000a

aV\u000aI would first like to thank Jeff for the gentle reminder a few nights ago for me to get my rear end in gear and post again. Apparently I'm holding up the post ... wagon(?). Talking of which, discussions are underway within the remaining five of us, now that Ben has moved on, to try to figure out a new and hopefully improved system for the blog next semester. Our goal when we started out was to average six ever exciting entries a week, but actually accomplishing this with the current number of bloggers turned out to be harder than we expected. So we're hoping to get a couple more student bloggers on board, in addition to some guest posts from alumni/ anyone else that might have something relevant to say. As always, we'd love to hear your thoughts and ideas.\u000aOn my end, given that we have just under a month of summer left before we get back to school, I'm scrambling to finish up at work, get through the tasks that need to get done while at home (eye doctor, dentist, eat a lot, etc etc) and maybe even get a start on grad. school stuff -- I'm scheduled to take my GRE's this Friday! Eeee! Between all that, I have been able to get away and enjoy the summer a good amount. Last week, my sister and I did a weekend trip to Washington DC to visit my friend and future suitemate, Keri, and just be shameless tourists.

aV\u000aWhen I heard the phrase "gap year" brought up at Candidate's Weekend, it was something I was absolutely positive I would never do. Taking a gap year was like failing, right? I mean, you would only do that if you didn't get into Olin the first time, right?\u000a\u000aLong story short, I got waitlisted in the Olin Class of 2016. I was all\u000a\u000aAnd I decided to go to another school, which we can call WC. WC had a good reputation for tough academics. This was totally true if what they meant by tough academics was\u000a\u000aBy the beginning of November, I started filling out transfer applications. I knew I wanted to be at a school where the work was challenging, and fun happened when the work was done. It was also important to me to find a place where fun didn't have to be alcoholic.\u000aSo, at the beginning of January I was sick of filling out applications, so I called up Charlie Nolan. (Disclaimer: don't try this at home.) I'm going to paraphrase how that conversation went:\u000aMe: So you know that gap year thing I was supposed to tell you about like 9 months ago?\u000aCharlie: Yes.\u000aMe: Can I do that now?\u000aCharlie: This is unusual.\u000aLucky me, it all worked out.\u000aIn September I attended my second freshman orientation, which I was clearly very excited about:\u000a\u000a(Despite my reservations, orientation was truly a ton of fun.)\u000aReflecting on my first semester so far, I am so much happier at Olin than I think I would be anywhere else. I am grateful to WC, because now I have something to compare the Olin experience to.\u000aUnlike most schools, Olin's mission statement is a part of every decision made here. They don't just hand you a thick booklet of rules and corresponding punishments when you walk in and call it an honor code. The honor code is a set of truly important values, and when it is broken each case is treated as though it has no precedent.\u000aAlthough there is a ton of work here, the type of work we do here doesn't wear me out the way work did last year. There's not several hours' worth of reading to do at night. Instead, there's an hour of coding I need to do, an hour of reading, and an hour of building a sketch model for design nature. It makes the amount of work we have to do seem less exhausting when it seems like it's actually working to a goal. Isn't it always better to feel like your work is going somewhere?\u000aFinally, Olin does fun right. Here are some examples:\u000a(An engineering discovery Bottle Rockets workshop in November)\u000a\u000a(A ride on the T during orientation)\u000a\u000a(Graham's giant beach ball, larger than Zoher)\u000a(And this snapchat of my name tag on Doyung)\u000aAll I can say is that I love this place, and I'm glad I'm here, but my gap year makes me appreciate it all the more.\u000a\u000aKe$Ha gif from perezhilton.com, all other gifs from whatshouldwecallme.tumblr.com.

aV\u000aI couldn't help giving a quick shout out to Olin's Jeff Stanton (c/o '10 -- wow that feels weird to say, I feel old) for placing as one of the seven winners of a graphic design competition sponsored by Google Earth. With a tag line that read "How would your campus look in 3D? You show us," the contest, shockingly enough, involved creation of a 3D rendering of your home campus using SketchUp.\u000a         Teams from seven of the over two hundred schools registered for the competition were selected as winners -- these seven teams are going to be flown out to California to visit Google's campus, and will attend a 3D modeling workshop as part of their visit. Congratulations, Jeff!\u000a\u000aHere's a quick peek at some of Jeff's drawings, but for more check out his webpage here.\u000aFront view of the Olin Centre.Back view of one of our residence halls, East Hall. \u000a

aV\u000aI'd like to talk about the best day of any Oliner's semester. This is, of course, build-your-own pizza lunch in the dining hall. The day that there's a buffet of pizza doughs, sauces, cheeses, and toppings, and every Oliner constructs a personal pizza refined to their tastes and preferences. And it gets cooked into a bubbly gooey mass of deliciousness.\u000a\u000aIn a way, the Olin culture is a build-your-own pizza. I was thinking of writing a post on one of the most common questions I was asked by Candidates and parents at Candidates' Weekend - "what do Oliners do to relax? What do you do for fun?" And I started writing, and I realized immediately that I wasn't qualified to answer the question. Not because I don't relax (all the movies and midnight pancake study breaks!) but because everyone does it differently. There is no single "way to relax." Everyone does it differently. Everyone builds their own relaxation pizza.\u000aAnd if you think about it, the whole curricular structure is a pizza as well. The first-years start with the same classes first semester (everyone's pizza has to have a basic dough on the bottom) and slowly diverge into different preferences of sauce, cheese, and extracurricular toppings. Personally, I like my pizza with thick dough, red sauce, tons of cheese, all the meat toppings, and a hint of spices. Similarly, I like my education with Electrical and Computer engineering (tons of software), a hint of MechE with Human Powered Vehicles team, and a wide variety of clubs and activities to take up the meat of my free time.\u000aThat's what I love about Olin. Everyone has their own pizza. And best of all, the college lays it all out in a buffet style so you can pick and choose your favorites. If you don't see the topping you want on the table, you can get it from somewhere else, or take initiative to start it up. There are people who pile all the toppings they can possibly cram onto their pizza; there are some who like it plain.\u000aObviously, this isn't a perfect metaphor. The pizzas don't really collaborate with each other the way Olin students assist and affect each other's education and experience. Pizzas have had basically the same structure since back when they were invented; the Olin education is trying to be continuously innovative (I'm in a co-curricular to make sure that happens). Pizzas are also not very good at solving complex engineering problems; Olin students are.\u000aThe takeaway from all this is that Olin gives you a fun, personalized experience. Also that pizza is delicious.\u000a

aV\u000a        Because not everything can fit in the 1-hour standard tour, let's take a photo tour of some of my favorite Olin places that aren't on the loop:\u000aParcel BParcel B is an undeveloped lot behind East Hall and the soccer fields (the actual buildings at Olin were build on "Parcel A"), and the ability to go on a quick "outside" walk there is a major factor in my sanity. \u000aParcel B is also used for off-road robot and vehicle testing, the Beekeeping co-curricular's hives (Parcel Bees, naturally), and as home to several trebuchets.\u000a\u000a\u000a The Large Project Building (behind the AC)\u000aThe large project building was Olin's 6th new building (Olin also uses some existing houses along Great Plains Ave), officially making us a counted-on-two-hands institution. The Large Project Building is used for, well, large projects, that need a dedicated workshop space for an extended period of time: right now, it hosts 2 SCOPE teams, the Human Powered Vehicle (HPV) team, Olin's robotic sailing program (SailBot), Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship (ADE) projects, the Baja-SAE team, and the electric vehicles research team (REVO), as well as a ventilated workspace, a minishop and a large pool for various aquatic robots. \u000aThe Laundry Room (basement of East Hall)Okay, so the laundry room isn't exactly my favorite place, but I'm sure glad it exists. (There are also small laundry rooms in each floor of West Hall). Bike RoomAlso in the basement of East Hall, the bike room, unsurprisingly, is full of bikes, including a communal set of anyone-can-use GO bikes. 90% of the time, I can happily get where I want to go on a bike: there are grocery stores, banks, libraries, post offices, and commuter rail stations in Needham and Wellesley (both 10-15 minutes away biking), and Eliot and Riverside (the nearest T-stations) are both 20-30 minutes away.\u000aStairwell SmileyWant to know where it is? You'll have to come find it yourself :)I hope this gives a taste of some of the "places" of daily life at Olin. Did I miss anywhere important?

aV\u000a            There are jokes that get spoiled upon explanation: "It's humorous because the character is acting in a manner that is generallyregarded as stereotypical." For practical jokes, or pranks, the opposite is true. Telling the story of how a prank came to be conceived, how it was crafted, and how it inevitably came crashing down is an art form. Indeed, retelling this story transforms an afternoon's hi-jinks into the stuff of legend.\u000a\u000a\u000aNow, before this year I never considered myself to be a prankster. I avoided trodding on toes, and was quick to smooth over faux-pas or other transgressions. However, upon my return to campus, something within me flipped. I realized that, since time heals all wounds, all will be forgiven if the joke is funny enough. After all, who would turn down the chance to be immortalized in legend?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBased on my experiences, I have codified a few rules of pranking that I would encourage any up-and-comer to follow:\u000a\u000aFirst, noirreversibleactions. Nothing broken, nothing you can't reconstructdeconstructed. You break it, you buy it.\u000a\u000aNext, no long term effects. No way will the joke be funny the thirtieth, fortieth time it comes around, so don't go there.\u000a\u000aFinally, no grudges. Don't play a prank on a person you don't like: It is the path to ruin. The best idea is to let someone else pick the targets. Then they know you don't mean them any harm!\u000a\u000a\u000aIt's been a busy semester so far, but I've managed to cram in a solid prank or two, and I have a number of others brewing.\u000a\u000a    I started out small. Over the summer, the president of Games club (Paul, 2013) okayed the purchase of a gigantic chess set - each square the size of a regular board. With the help of a new freshman friend (who might wish to remain anonymous), I set up the board and pieces in someone's room while they were away. We moved the white king's pawn forward and attached a note to the door: "Your move," it said.\u000a\u000a\u000aNo damages, no lasting effects, no vindictiveness. Check, check, checkmate.\u000a\u000a    My next prank took a little more organization. I found three sets of roommates who would be occupied for a given two-hour period. I assembled fifteen able-bodied men and women, and we began to move things. We took all of X's furniture + accessories (half the room!) out of the fourth floor, down to Y's room on the second floor. Y's things went to Z's room on the third floor, and Z's filled the gap in X's room. A perfectlyorchestratedswitch. The furniture lined up, and the new roommate pairings turned out quite well too. They only ended up switching back weeks later!\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI would be remiss if I didn't mention the excellent pranks played thus far by others in my community, which involve stringing up a classmate's personal belongings in accordance with creepy poems, and also (another time) flipping her entire room upside down and affixing it to the ceiling. Lots of respect.\u000a\u000aThere were many others, but I won't detract from these tales with lesser pranks. Still, there are two more stories to tell. One will be a surprise even to me: At this year's SERV auction (organized by our student community service group, in which individuals donate goods and services) I contributed a 'Prank the Person of your Choice' item, promising my skills, time, and craftiness for a practical joke of undetermined proportions. This one is still up in the air.\u000a\u000a    The other prank is ongoing. It is different in that it fell into my lap, and I perpetuate it by doing absolutely nothing. I am helped by the members of my community, all but one of whom know the truth. We are colluding to pull a prank on one person: Kendall (2013).\u000a\u000aI took FBE (an introduction to business course that is a graduation requirement at Olin) last semester. Remembering it fondly, I decided at the beginning of this semester to drop by and see how the current class was doing. During one hectic activity involving Lego, I went in and congratulated Kendall on her innovation, and then briefly spoke with my old professor. I thought nothing of the encounter, but later that week, I was informed by a mutual friend that Kendall had been led to believe that I was a teaching assistant (a 'Ninja' as they are known here). Sensing my opportunity, I resolved to convince her of the fact. I insinuated myself onto class mailing lists by again speaking with her professor. I made sure to chat with her about her impressions of the class and offered what advice I could. I even sat in on a few of the more interesting lectures!\u000a\u000aThe prank vaunted to even greater proportions just as the month-long 'FBE challenge' was starting up. There were seven groups and five legitimate Ninjas who would 'invest' in each company and provide them with immediate feedback and advice. The professor would have taken two companies on, so when Kendall's group was one of two remaining unpaired, I swooped in and snagged it! Her teammates were more than happy to play along with the joke. For the duration of the 'challenge', I consciously avoided doing any work for this class. The team got their advice from their professor, as they would have had I not intervened. The kicker is that, during their summary presentations, Kendall was the team member in charge of reporting on their successful 'investor relations.'\u000a\u000aKendall still has no idea that I am not a 'ninja' for her FBE class.\u000aIf you know her, please don't tell her.\u000aBelieve me, I'll be getting to that soon enough.\u000a\u000aI don't believe she reads this blog anymore, but if she does...\u000a\u000a\u000aGotcha!\u000a\u000a\u000a

aV\u000aHey there!\u000aIt's Haley again, now reporting to you as a sophomore! (Weird how that happens...) I've noticed that I tend to direct my posts towards Prospies, but I realize that not everyone who reads the OLINsider is one. So, if you aren't actually a prospective student (hi mom!), just pretend that you are. It'll be fun.\u000aIf you're anything like I was when I was a Prospie, then you've probably been dying to know what the schedule of a typical Oliner looks like! If that's the case... well, you aren't exactly in luck. Despite our small size, there is a lot to do here. I don't know the actual numbers, but I do know that our club-to-student ratio is ridiculous. Factor in classes, co-curriculars, passionate pursuits, research, and a whole assortment of other activities, and you've got endless scheduling possibilities! So, while I couldn't possibly show you a "typical" schedule, nor tell you about every single thing that's going on here, I can show you my schedule, which will hopefully allow you a sufficient glimpse into at least some aspects of student life here at Olin.\u000aClasses\u000aI'm really excited about my schedule this semester! Not only do I never have a class before 10:50am, but I also have "Weekend Wednesdays." Woohoo! Beyond this wonderful occurrence, however, I am genuinely looking forward to my classes. Now that I've moved away from first-year requirements, I have more wiggle room to take some that I'm really interested in. This semester I'm taking:\u000aGame Programming So far, this is my favorite class. It's exactly what it sounds like. We're three weeks in and I've already made a text-based version of the game 2048 and recreated the game Rush Hour with my partner Bonnie Ishiguro '17! As an aspiring E:C major (Engineering with a focus in Computing), this is exactly the kind of stuff that often feels more like "fun" than "work" to me.\u000a\u000aRemember this?\u000aMobile PrototypingIn this class, we're learning how to create Android apps, and in the coming weeks we will be starting to work on projects with outside collaborators. Basically, this means we'll be meeting with company liaisons to help design apps for them! While I'm a bit nervous about this, it will definitely be a great chance to get some real-world experience.\u000aLinearity II(which is a math class) We are currently learning about optimization, and the project I've just started with fellow blogger Charlie Mouton '17 is about minimizing the number of steps it takes to get from any given point on campus to another. (Thus we shall reclaim our place as The Princeton Review's Easiest Campus to Get Around!)\u000aPrinciples of Engineering(or POE, as we like to call it) For the first half of this class, we're working on some labs (for example, our current lab involves constructing a 3D scanner). The real fun, however, starts once we embark on our final project, which is what the second half of the class is devoted to. Teams of four are tasked with building a device of their own choosing, so long as that device involves a mechanical system and an electrical system with both hardware and software components. (More info:http://olin.edu/academics/experience/principles-of-engineering/)\u000aFive More Topics for Software DesignersThis is technically not a class, but a 1-credit seminar that meets once a week. Taught by Olin alum Ben Salinas '10, we're learning skills that will help us design software that is both beautiful and usable. For reference, the five topics are graphic design, designing with real data, rapidly prototyping software experiences, data visualization, and software development.\u000aActivities\u000aAs much as we all love classes (which is actually a true statement more often than not), there is so much more going on here! I'll give you just a taste by telling you about some other things that I'm involved in:\u000aLocal Massachusetts History A co-curricular activity in which we take field trips to historically significant locations in Massachusetts and learn a bit about their history. As a Massachusetts native, I am all over this kind of stuff. This past Saturday we took a walk around Walden Pond, and even took turns readingWaldenon Walden!\u000a\u000aCouch to 5k This is a co-curricular about getting your butt off the couch and running. At least, that's what it's about for me. We'll be following a running schedule for the next 8 weeks, and at the end, we'll finish it off by running a 5k!\u000aOVAL(Olin Volunteer Ambassadors League) This is the group that organizes campus tours as well as hosting overnight guests. I'll be giving weekly tours on Wednesdays and acting as a host, so if you're a Prospie, I may very well get to meet you!\u000aOFAC(Olin Fire Arts Club) I occasionally dabble in the arts. By which I mean fire arts. I have been known to swing balls of flame around my body when the mood strikes me.\u000aAnime Club We meet on Saturday nights to watch anime! We're currently watchingJoJo's Bizarre Adventure, which is indeed both bizarre and quite an adventure.\u000aGame Development Club Because I can't get enough of game programming, I also just joined this brand new club! We started pitching ideas for games at our first meeting on Saturday, and soon we'll be breaking up into teams to make those ideas come to life. It's gonna bereally, really cool!\u000aCryptography& Cyber Security ClubandComputing Conversations Two more awesome new clubs that I just joined! I can't say too much about either as they haven't officially met yet, but they promise to be a lot of fun. Starting a new club for something you're interested in is super easy, which is one of countless great things about Olin.\u000aPretty awesome, right? And I haven't even scratched the surface! There are so many other clubs and activities whose members would jump at the chance to tell you all about what they do. So, Prospies: if at any point while reading this you were even slightly intrigued, consider coming to visit! We tour guides love to answer your questions, and if you think you'd be down for an overnight stay, we'll do our best to bring you to any classes/clubs/co-curriculars/other activities you might be interested in.\u000aI hope this post inspires at least one visit! At the very least, I hope you've learned something about what it's like to be a student here. While it can be hectic at times, it's also a tremendously fun, exciting, and rewarding experience.\u000aHappy Olin-visiting!\u000aHaley Pelletier '17\u000a

aV\u000aIt's Wednesday night. You're sitting in your dorm room (like you do), working on an assignment for Modeling and Simulation that's due at midnight. It's not very hard, but it's frustratingly time-consuming - like eating a slightly overcooked scallop. Youthink you've got the right answer for #6, but you're not absolutely sure. Maybe you should check the MATLAB events file to see if ODE's got the proper directional - wait. What was that? Are those... footsteps? Is there someone running through the hallway?\u000a And then, as if from an angel on high announcing a football game through a slightly blown-out loudspeaker, you hear it. Every first-year's favorite sentence:\u000a"PASS/NO RECOOOOOOORD!"\u000aThis is the part of the story where you find out that the sophomores are staging an enormous Nerf gun battle in the first floor lounge, run downstairs to join them, forget completely about your homework, have a blast, wind up accidentally falling down on top of your secret crush, kiss passionately, graduate from Olin with flying colors despite your incorrect answer to #6 on Wednesday November 13th's ModSim diagnostic, get married, and have 2.7 children with your Olin-found true love.\u000aThe only problem?\u000aNone of this actually happens. \u000aI must've heard the story from thirty different people - OK, I made up the 2.7 children bit - but so far this semester I've been thoroughly underwhelmed by the reality of Olin's Pass/No Record system. (For those of you who read the Olinsider and somehow still don't know about Pass/No Record, hi mom! It's this thing where we don't have grades for our first semester classes, and even if we fail they don't go on our transcript.) There've been no straight-line marches to the Chipotle Grill. There've been no inter-floor Nerf wars.There've been no sophomores running through my hall at 11 PM shouting at the top of their lungs - which is probably a good thing, come to think of it. At any rate, either the spirit of Pass/No Record has been grossly misrepresented, or I'm even less aware of my surroundings than this guy:\u000aI can absolutely understand why the legend of Pass/No Record and the reality of my first semester at Olin haven't quite lined up. For one thing, as much as the first semester is supposed to imbue students with a freewheeling spirit of adventure, no one wants toactuallyno-record something. It's nice that a failed class doesn't wind up on your transcript, but you still have to retake the darn thing, which is for many students a bigger disincentive than an F. And if you happen to no-record more than one class... well, there are some nasty stories about students who no-recorded a little too hard and were "asked" not to return to Olin. That'd be the worst of all cases.\u000aI bring this up because, less than two weeks ago, I was seriously concerned about the possibility of no-recording ModCon. I got several labs behind due to a series of circumstances that were at least 100% my own fault, and then I lost almost an entire week to the Franklin W. Olin Players production of Brighton Beach Memoirs, and then it began to seem as though I might lose another week and change to an immediate family crisis, and all of a sudden I looked up at the calendar and I had seven days (at most) to do seven ModCon labs.\u000aI confess that I don't exactly remember how I pulled it off - I think there might have been some intravenous coffee involved - but I managed to get all seven labs done, and done beautifully, infive days.It was pretty impressive. It was also completely insane. Prospies who read this, don't be like me. Over those five days, I spent more time in the ModCon lab than in my room, which is right up there with "drop an eight pound clamp on my head" on the list of things I never want to do again.\u000aBut my near-miss with ModCon, more than just inspiring a blog post that I can never tell my parents about, taught me the Real Meaning (TM) of Pass/No Record. It's not about crazy one-off adventures and abandoned assignments. It's about the time frame, the ability to get stuff in a little bit late and a little not perfect, the chance to spend some time getting to know your classmates rather than doing homework. It's about increasing opportunity. It's pretty darn cool.\u000aAs long as you Pass, that is.\u000a

aV\u000aI was getting into bed in my sparse hostel room outside of Siena, Italy a week and a half ago when it suddenly struck me: in a matter of weeks I will be back in the United States, and I'm actually going to miss this - this lifestyle, this experience, this place.  Those with whom I have not corresponded closely might scoff at my use of the word "actually."  I realize that spending a semester in Europe might sound romantic and exciting and wonderful - it certainly did to me, before I arrived here - but it really isn't what you might expect.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOn top of Siena's bell tower. 'Twas quite windy.\u000a\u000a\u000aA friend recently e-mailed me to ask a physics question, and then later apologized for bothering me during my semester in Europe, when I really ought to be "turning inward and becoming self-reflective" rather than doing physics.  I laughed. I feel like spending a semester in Europe is more about traveling and hostels and miscommunication and having tickets or reservations for the wrong day and showering in strange configurations and ordering food when you aren't quite sure what it's going to be and running into random friends and friends of friends and seeing cool stuff and spending a lot of money to climb up things and take pictures.  My abroad experience in particular has been more about struggling to make friends, missing Olin, and longing for some really good tofu pad thai.\u000aI hadn't expected to be so homesick.  I hadn't expected my roommates to all be best friends and have such little interest in me, my friendship, or what I had to say.  I hadn't expected to meet so few Italians.  I hadn't expected to start taking Rome for granted so quickly.  But I had expected it to end very quickly, which it is certainly going to do.

aV\u000aIt's Spring Break! It's 64 F and sunny outside, so why not ride my scooter to Wellesley and have breakfast at Starbucks? I could even write a blog post!\u000a\u000aNot really sure where to start. It's been a while since we last talked and a lothas happened since then. Tons. Metric tonnes.\u000aOf course, that's a feeling not unique to me. The "desperately in need of a break to recharge" feeling has been running rife recently, possibly aided by spots of good weather. This has led to outbreaks of eating outside and convincing professors that the O is a classroom.\u000a\u000a\u000aSee, it's a classroom!\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLast time we did this it must have been August.\u000a\u000aUOCD has been a particular source of stress for the Class of 2014. It's certainly been a struggle figuring out how to "play the game" of UOCD, but that's a conversation for another time. Suffice to say, it's led to some interesting moments:\u000a\u000a\u000aPoor Elliott. I don't know where things went wrong for him. He comes up with some great ideas though.\u000a\u000aWhilst classes take up a big chunk of time, I also got myself involved with a bunch of extracurriculars. My independent study in Communicating Olin started off as a simple enough project, but has ended up going deep. Very deep. We've got ourselves into questions about Olin's mission and the state of education in America, not just "how can we make the website better". It's hard. There have been some great meetings when people like Mark Somerville and Lynn Stein triple the IQ in the room and blow our minds away. On the flip side, Mark can also be confused by his busy calendar:\u000a\u000a\u000a"What...what are these? Where did these come from? I don't even..."\u000a\u000aWorking for or talking about Olin has become something I spend a lot of time doing, so much so that I am now officially affiliated with I2E2. The paycheck is nice, but the fancy name tag is even better:\u000a\u000a\u000aIt's been great getting the opportunity to promote Olin to visitors from other institutions. It feels like we're helping in Olin's mission to change the paradigm ofengineeringeducation and it's always interesting to hear what people have to say about us.\u000a\u000aThis seems very ironic considering where I was three years ago. As you probably know, Olin sent out their acceptance decisions a few days ago. Some students will be going ballistic with excitement, but I know there are a few who will be getting a disappointingly thin envelope. Looking back, it's hard to believe at what the last three years have been to me. Being an I2E2 Liasion means a lot to me since in some ways it cements my place in this chapter of my life and highlights how much my abilities and interests have changed over the past three years. Words like "design", "pedagogy", "paradigms", and "as an Olin student" weren't even on my radar-screen at the end of high school.\u000a\u000aSure, things are busier than they've ever been and there have been several points during the semester when I've felt like I was going to sink rather than swim. But with the nice weather, the time off, and the feeling of "we've made it this far", it's been great to look back and see where things have come from.\u000a\u000aThe next two months are going to hurt, but as with all things at Olin, the pay-off will be big in the long run.\u000a

aV\u000aMy first confession: my profile is currently lying to you.  My major is not actually Engineering with a concentration in Systems - yet.  It will be eventually.  I've filled out all the forms, I've been taking the necessary courses, I've told my academic adviser of my plans...  I just haven't turned the forms in yet.  They're sitting right here next to me on my desk, keeping me company as I write.  My major is actually declared as Mechanical Engineering, and has been for the past year.  Olin requires sophomores entering the spring semester to declare a major, and at the time, I thought I wanted to be a mechanical engineer.  I subsequently took Software Design with Allen Downey, and decided I would be unhappy without programming in my life.  So here I am, a proud soon-to-be E:Sys major (or as some say, Sys-E, pronounced like "sissy"), taking Computer Architecture alongside Fundamentals of Machine Shop Operations.\u000a\u000a        Once I finally get my change-of-major forms turned in, it's time to finish my Study Abroad applications.  I'm planning to apply to John Cabot University in Rome, Italy.  I don't speak Italian, but I certainly love the food, so I refuse to be daunted by language/cultural barriers.  I'm so excited at the prospect of studying abroad that I don't even know what to do with myself, which brings me to my second confession: I am a strangely sporadic procrastinator.  I sometimes finish homework immediately after the class in which it's assigned, and sometimes wait until the night before to do the bulk of the work on it.  The latter seems to be the case with my study away applications: I'm still several forms, an application fee, and a personal statement away from approval, and am at least somewhat lacking in motivation to complete them.  I know it's what I want to do, but let's face it: filling out forms is not the most intellectually stimulating way to spend one's afternoon.\u000aMy third confession is quite unrelated to the first two: I am a Thai food addict.  Although Olin's dining hall does a pretty good job at most types of food, their attempts at Pad Thai have been fairly abysmal thus far.  Fortunately for me and my Thai food junkie brethren, there are no fewer than four Thai restaurants in the area, all within a five minute drive.  Two of these even deliver, which is excellent for my late-evening cravings, or for those days when dinner in the dining hall just isn't satisfactory.  I've also found that if I can save up some money (I work at Olin as a tutor/grader for the freshmen to support my habit), go to one of the restaurants and order more food than I can possibly eat, the leftovers can last me for several days.  In fact, I had leftover Pad Thai for lunch today, and I still have some panang curry in the refrigerator.  Yay!\u000aHere's to hoping that there's at least some Thai food in Italy, or that gelato is a sufficient substitute!\u000aAngela\u000a

aV\u000aIf you are reading this, there is a chance that you have just gotten your acceptance letter from Olin.\u000aIf you have, CONGRATULATIONS!!!\u000aI'll never forget the day I waited anxiously by the door for the FedEx man to appear and hand me that envelope, and the multitude of texts to my friends from Candidate's Weekend that followed.\u000aIn honor of this exciting time, I figured I'd share the story of how I decided to come to Olin with you. Mind you, it's been four years, so the details may not be perfect, but I'll do my best. Also, I don't have pictures for this story, so use your imagination =].\u000aFirst off, I want to tell you that I didn't think I'd get in to candidate's weekend. That's right, I was one of the many people I've talked to who didn't think I'd make it through the first round. I literally ignored my candidate's weekend envelope in the pile of mail because I assumed it was for my mother (whoops)!\u000aWhen I was accepted to Olin, I wanted to make a well informed decision. Being the levelheaded member of the family, my mom told me to consider all of my options.\u000aSo for a month, 'I did.' I spent 'time' on other school's websites, talked to my teachers and peers, and made pro-con charts. I realized I had one fear: I didn't think I was good enough to do the work. Design Nature seemed like an impossible thing to ask of first year students, and I had literally no engineering experience under my belt. I was worried I'd fail, and back then, failure wasn't a good thing.\u000aIn previous years (and maybe this year, too), Olin has offered accepted students the chance to shadow a student for a day. My mom and I agreed it would be a good idea for me to go, so I emailed the coordinator, Scott ('12), and made plans to visit a few days before finals period for Olin students. I arrived with my deposit (just in case).\u000aWithin 20 minutes of my first class, I knew. There we were, sitting in Modeling and Simulation of Electricity and Magnetism, and I understood what was going on. I followed the basics of the relativity that Mark Somerville was teaching.\u000aWe walked out of class, and I went straight to admissions. One of the staff members had interviewed me, so I walked into her office, and handed her my signed acceptance and deposit. Everyone in the office clapped, and I smiled.\u000aI had an entire night of memories I'd never forget after making that deposit. I helped Dugger and Tanner ('13) ruin the aerogel they were making. I watched a group of students work excitedly together on homework in the lounges. I participated in a southern-sweet-tea study break in Tanner and Andrew's ('13) room. I had an hour long, deep conversation with Geoff ('13), who I had literally just met (we later became great friends). I went on a tour of the (former) art room with Kelsey ('13). I took apples from the dining hall and baked apple crisp after midnight with Kelsey and Kat ('13.5). I attended final presentations the next day where one began with students running into the classroom shooting nerf guns.\u000aI told my Olin friends the story of my visit later, and they laughed. I did so many things in a day, but more importantly, I did so many Olin things in a day. The reason I chose Olin wasn't the classwork, or the type of education I was going to get (though, in retrospect, that was an important thing). I chose Olin for the culture. The community. The people. I wanted to make memories like those the class of 2013 was making.\u000aI can tell you right now that I did. I am 100% happy with the decision I made. Sure, there are times when Olin feels too small, or I wish I had a chance to take a larger variety of classes, but those small feelings never come close to outweighing the happiness and love I feel for Olin.\u000aI have less than two months until I leave, and I know that things will be different when I'm gone. I believe that my love for the culture and people at Olin will not fade. So, reader, if you're thinking about coming to Olin, think about what else we have besides our curriculum - or at least, think about the people component of the curriculum.\u000aBest of luck in your decisions! Time for me to go hit the beach with 10 of my best Olin friends =]\u000a<3\u000aJordyn\u000a

aV\u000a        Hi there! I suppose it's time for me to write a fashionably late first OLINsider blog post. Nice to meet you, I'm Emily. =) I flew over to the phoenix nest (Olin campus) from northern California (hurrah for the Bay Area!). I'm also a biology nerd (more specifically, I'm interested in exploring engineering disciplines in a biological context--biorobotics, anyone? ) and bubble tea enthusiast who plays the flute. ^__^\u000a\u000a\u000aWe thought that most of our guests from the Decade One celebration had returned home already, but the school has decided to cancel class in order to accommodate for our stormy guest: Hurricane Sandy! \u000a\u000aas of 1:28pm~ Credits to Abe Levitan ('2016) for creating and maintaining the counter.\u000a\u000a\u000aSpontaneous preparations and activities have gone quite splendidly so far. People have chosen to either be productive (i.e. a couple of friends and I were spending some quality time with our circuits in the fourth floor of the academic center last night) or make the most out of this hurricane weekend (shout out to the freshmen who cleared all of the Rock Band Beatles songs yesterday!).\u000a\u000aOr, perhaps you'll choose to sit casually with the whirling leaves and eat an apple.\u000a\u000aOther Sandy-inspired ventures include chocolate pancakes, a slew of board games, quests for German food (cooked by the lovely Sophia Seitz, '2016, as shown below running in the rain and cooking in the kitchen), pumpkin carving, and well-deserved naps!\u000a\u000a\u000aWell, it looks like this blog post is about to end (but the adventures shall never cease!). I wonder how long Sandy's going to stay over at the Olin bubble. Thanks for reading! Stay tuned for more updates about Design Nature transporters and freshman activities. :D\u000a

aV\u000aHello, everyone!\u000aMy name is Ariana, and I am a first year here at Olin. Things are super hectic around here as usual with projects and clubs and other cool stuff, and I am super excited to be here!\u000aIve been think a lot about Pass/No Record recently. For those of you who dont know, Pass/No Record is Olins policy where first semester first years do not receive grades in their classes. The only two options are passing the class or receiving no record of taking the class at all.\u000aPass/No Record is designed to allow first years to adjust to Olins workload and have fun without worrying too much about grades. Its there for us to experiment and learn how much we are capable of doing, try ALL the clubs, and goof off. If you ever hang out with the first years, youll almost definitely hear someone shout Pass/No Record! at least once in reference to doing something cool like a club or an outing into Boston instead of doing work.\u000aEveryone approaches Pass/No Record differently. Some of us will use it as an opportunity to focus on the classes we are most interested in, others will join a million extracurriculars to explore which clubs and activities we are interested in focusing on in later semesters. All approaches work for some Oliners and not for others. However, I think we can all agree that we are thankful to have Pass/No Record as a safety net as we are adjusting to the pace and workload of Olin.\u000aI am approaching Pass/No Record as an opportunity to figure out the balance between work and fun stuff. Im forming a work routine that I can stick to. I try to get good quality work turned in on time, but sometimes I overload myself and I have to scramble to turn in work that I know could be better had I given myself more time to complete it. However, I approach every rushed assignment as a learning opportunity. In the future, I will know better how to stay on top of my work and balance everything I have to do. Sometimes that means forcing myself to sit down and work when I could be goofing off, or admitting that maybe I dont have enough time to do every club I had originally signed up for.\u000aPass/No Record is awesome because it allows new students to adjust to Olin life and explore their interests without stressing about bad grades. Everyone takes advantage of it differently, but any way you do it, youll end up learning a lot about yourself!\u000aUntil next time,\u000aAriana\u000a\u000aWhy I love Pass/No Record. Theres so much to do and so little time!\u000a

aV\u000a        As you may know, I love Olin. I can even provide evidence for that claim, like my returning here repeatedly, of my own free will, even though there isn't a real mountain anywhere in the same state (Sorry Massachusetts. You have other things going for you, but mountains isn't one of them). So please, do not be scandalized if I tell you I also love breaks from Olin. This week is/was/will continue to be an excellent break, coming just when I needed it immensely.\u000aYou see, in the push to finish work up before the break, I used up all my engineering brain cells. I am sure this week all the little brain gremlins* have been running around untangling neurons and building bridges and laying in a fine new supply of engineering juice - in fact, I know they have, because I fired up solidworks today just to make some pretty renders of old mechanical prototyping projects. While the gremlins have been about their work, I have been hanging at Olin, visiting cousins in New York, and, in technical terms, "chilling".\u000a \u000a        I slept for many, many hours. I cleaned my room. I tried to take pictures for you all, but they just did not give justice to the sense of disorder the mess was making. But you can take my word for it, it is a much more pleasant space now. \u000aI read a microwave oven's worth of books.\u000aI wandered through Needham Town Forest (for all the trouble I give Massachusetts about their mountains, I will grant that they have excellent New England forests. Not to be confused with excellent Northwest forests, but excellent nonetheless.)In one corner, someone has set up several little pieces of a "village". It looks like there may have been a model train set there too at one point.Sleep, books, time outside, family - yep, I'm pretty sure there's not a better way to recover. I hope this break has been refreshing, restful and re-filling for you as well, and happy Thanksgiving everyone!\u000a*Hey, I'm an engineer, not a neuroscientist.\u000a\u000a

aV\u000a*from the perspective of a first year.\u000aFirst, the most obvious category (and probably what you've heard most about):\u000aAcademics\u000a1. Circuits\u000aI freaking love circuits. Let's talk about that.\u000aI came into Olin expecting to be a mechanical engineer, but I'm finding with every new circuits class that I just love building circuits.\u000aCircuits are cool, and they look cool, and they do cool things (when they're built right).\u000a\u000aBut in all seriousness, I've done some really fun things with circuits in my classes. Just this semester I have built my own power source, ECG, strain-gauge, and I have read my heartbeat by standing on a bathroom scale. And all of that was unimaginable to me just a few months ago.\u000aOne of the most exciting things I have done so far was my ModCon final project with Aditi, and we built an auditropic cat on wheels which moved whenever it got sound input.\u000aWe even got tweeted about:\u000a\u000a2. Machine shops\u000aNow that I've nerded all over the place about circuits, I'm going to man up and talk about machine shops.\u000aBefore coming to Olin, I had never once touched a machine shop. After a semester and a half, I feel comfortable using a drill press, band saw, and belt sander, as well as press-fitting and heat-staking.\u000aAll of that may sound like gibberish to you, but look at what we built with it!\u000aA mechanical pangolin held together by plastic, wire, and hot glue (lots). It curled into a ball and moved forward or backward.\u000a\u000a3. NINJAs\u000aI'll be completely honest with you. I have no idea what NINJA stands for. All I know is that they're pretty awesome.\u000a(Update: It stands for Need Information Now Just Ask)\u000aHere at Olin, we call our course assistants NINJAs. In myopinion, they do much more than normal course assistants. They are more like tutors that are available almost whenever we need them. They hold office hours in the lounges, they hold tutorials in the labs, and they listen to us whine and groan whenever we have too much work in their class. They're like little parents.\u000a4. Different paces, different people\u000aSo if you've been reading this, and you've been all "OMG I have no idea what you're talking about,"\u000a\u000aor you've been reading this and you're all "OMG I already know how to do all that, so boring,"\u000a(the way you feel about me right now)\u000athen what I have to say to you is this:\u000aOlin faculty are fantastic at teaching to pace. Most of the first year curriculum is designed to be concious of the fact that all of you prospies probably have different backgrounds. So, if you come in with no coding experience, you're not going to struggle in vain. There are coding tutorials and lecture ea\u005cxtensions outside of class, and suplemental reading to catch you up. On the flip side, if you already program two languages and Matlab is a piece of cake (because Matlab is a glorified graphing calculator), then you don't have to attend the lecture extensions, but maybe you could even teach them. The same goes for circuitry, machine shops, and mathy things.\u000aCulture\u000a5. R2 Culture\u000aFor those that don't know, R2 stands for Resident Resource. Now, I would say that they were the equivalent of another campus' RA, but I would be lying.\u000aR2s are so much better than that.\u000aAt other schools, RAs are required to sign something saying that they will confiscate and report any underage student that they find drinking. As a result, the RA culture on campus generally becomes one of the RAs against the students. RAs are people to hide from, run away from, and generally try to limit any interaction with.\u000aThe great thing about R2s is that they don't have that restricition. What this allows is for the R2s to be a much better resource to students. Students can be best friends with the R2s (I count three of them as my own friends), and there is freedom to talk to your R2 about anything without fear of punishment. Additionally, parties are safer because R2s are able to be there to intercede if things ever go wrong.\u000a6. Drinking Culture\u000aOkay, so now I'm getting to what you all really wanted to talk about. Parents, look away.\u000aJust kidding.\u000aLet's be honest. It's college; there is going to be some drinking done by some individuals sometime during these four-five years.\u000a\u000aThe drinking culture at Olin is something I haven't seen at many other schools. The best way I can describe it is "casual."\u000aNow, everyone says this about their own schools, but I'm being completely honest:there is no pressure to drink at Olin if you don't want to.\u000aWhat that generally means at other schools is, "just don't go to the party if you don't want to drink." What it means at Olin, "you're welcome at the party even if you don't want to drink. Just come hang out." I promise, I'm being serious. I myself have gone to parties just to enjoy the company. I have equally as often spent Friday nights playing boardgames with friends or binge-watching netflix.\u000aBasically, whatever you want to do, you can probably find someone here who wants to do it too, whether you want to drink or not.\u000a7. Gender Culture\u000aNow for my secret feminist agenda.\u000a(^ You when I said that)\u000aBut really, the gender culture at Olin is pretty cool.\u000aIn my experience, I believe that the guys at Olin respect the girls at Olin much more as intellectuals than I have found elsewhere.\u000aThere is a lot of effort in general at Olin as well as in the gender space to stay openminded about things, to be understanding, and to talk about the issues.There are cocurriculars to talk about the experience of women in engineering. There are frequent conversations about what it means to be a woman and a man in today's world. There is even a drag show to raise questions about what gender really means.\u000aBasically, there is an effort to raise awareness and start conversations about gender stereotypes at Olin that you might not find at other engineering colleges.\u000a8. "Doctor" Culture\u000aSomething I have found interesting in my time here is that the professors here at Olin prefer to be called by their first name.\u000aAt my last school, professors were deeply offended and often angry if you didn't call them "Dr. BlahBlah." There was the general attitude that they had worked too hard for their PHDs to be called anything other than Doctor by their students.\u000aAt Olin, I have felt extremely comfortable calling all of my professors by their first names. I don't know if it is a product of the grassroots way this school was created, but I think it is a wonderful thing.\u000aIt encourages a personal relationship with the faculty and it makes them seem more approachable in general.

aV\u000aA phrase that gets thrown around a lot is jaded senior, referring to seniors that have lost the enthusiasm of Olin after 4 years. Everyone seems to imagine all these jaded seniors grumbling and mumbling about everything because they dont like what they have to do or they dont like that the classes are being taught differently than we were, or that all the first-years seem like overconfident young pricks (no offense first-years! Keep reading!) who have no idea what theyre getting into. As a senior, I have a whole bunch of opinions about Olin. Some of my thoughts have been negative, and others have been positive, but I realized that I havent thought about who I was when I was a first year in a long time. So I tried.\u000aAfter interacting with some of the members of the Class of 2019, I realized something. I had nearly completely forgotten all of the experiences I had freshman year, and my sophomore year memories werent far behind. The energy and the effort I put into my Design Nature hopper was long gone and all thats left is the story I tell on tours. I cant remember how much that story adheres to the original. I dont even remember the course material of Modeling and Simulation or Modeling and Control (now called An Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation, and Measurement). In my later classes too, I cant even begin to recall the late nights deriving systems of equations in Advanced Classical Mechanics, or how I went about programming a robotic tugboat in LabView for Fundamentals of Robotics. All of my underclassman experiences are somewhere deep in my memory, barely accessible, but some of those memories I remember being very groundbreaking for me. My Fundamentals of Robotics class, for example, was the class that convinced me to major in Engineering with Robotics. Software Design taught me that although I couldnt code well, it was something that I wanted to learn for the experience and background. All I remember are that these classes were important to me, and some of the challenges I faced seem very silly. But I can barely remember them because I never stopped to think about it.\u000a\u000aMy first Olin project: my hopper.\u000aI look at my classes and projects now, and I am amazed. Not at what Im doing specifically, but at how far Ive come, and how much Ive changed. This semester, Ive been working on things that first-year Alex would have no idea how to do. Im working with a hacked Neato robot and getting it to draw pictures for my final project in Computational Robotics. Last semester, I 3D printed a robot that could get itself off the build plate, which you can read about here. And this school year, Im in SCOPE, Olins senior capstone, where Im working with LIMBS International to improve the stability of their prosthetic knee. Comparing my projects now to my projects in my first year, Im amazed at how far Ive come. I dont know where I learned all of this stuff, but somehow, I seem to have made a lot of progress. Ive learned how to analyze, prototype, and build full systems. I can actually program well now. Just trying to push away the haze and remember what challenges I faced nearly four years ago, and what challenges Im facing now, really put into perspective how my Olin education has affected me, and how Ive changed. When I came in as a first year, I was the overconfident young prick who had no idea what he was doing. I had a huge ego and thought I could take on any challenge, no matter what the cost. Now, Ive learned what Im good at and what Im not so good at, and I know how to play to my strengths when tackling a problem to get the job done. I know that I have the experience to get things done well. Now, I know that I am an actual engineer.\u000a\u000aMy most recent Olin project: getting a Neato to draw pictures.\u000aMy reflection has made me re-evaluate the mentality toward Olin as a senior and appreciate my experiences because I can now see how far Ive come. So I guess you could say my reflection saved me from turning into a jaded senior. Whether you are a college student like myself, a high school student interested in Olin, or someone, somewhere with a job and all that grown-up stuff (Ill need to start thinking about becoming that soon), I encourage you to look at where you were three years ago, four years ago, to when you first started your job, first came into school as a first-year, and try to remember what you did. Remember what challenges you faced and how you solved them. Remember how excited you were about a new experience. Remember how little you knew what you were doing, and how much you know now. Dont forget how far youve come.\u000a

aV\u000aI want you to look inside your wallet/purse/clutch/bag right now. There should be this card somewhere:\u000a\u000a If you don't know what this is, it's basically a stored-value card that allows you quickly pass through Boston subway (also known colloquially as "the T") turnstiles while saving 50 cents each time* (I know right? Such huge savings!). If you don't have one, you can get one at Charlie Card kiosks at Kenmore, Arlington, and Park Street. I know sophomores who go out to Boston frequently and yet still don't have this card. Don't be that person.\u000a      Right, so onto how to actually get out of Olin. If you don't have a car and want to go to Boston on the weekend, the cheapest (free!) and somewhat-most-convenient way would be to take the Babson shuttle, the timetable for which can be found here:\u000ahttp://www.babson.edu/admission/visiting-babson/wellesley/shuttle schedule/Pages/thursday-saturday-shuttles.aspx\u000a Or just make friends with people who own cars. And get them to drive you to the T, you freeloader. The two closest stops would be Woodland and Eliot Station, at which you can buy a ticket or refill your handy-dandy Charlie Card. From there all you have to do is take an inbound train to whatever station pleases you.\u000a A couple of my favorite places that you can get to via the T or the bus would be:\u000a- SoWa Open Market: great food trucks and local handmade goodness every Sunday but is only open May through October.\u000a- Harvard Square: cool little shops on quaint streets for all you hipsters (must also mention Darwin's Ltd. which is a super delicious sandwich shop)\u000a- The South End: awesome breakfast sandwiches and world famous sticky buns at Flour Bakery and Caf; and the innovative and unique Clover Food Lab.\u000a- The Skywalk Observatory: awesome views of Boston. Go at sunset so you can get both a sunset and night view!\u000a Tired of the city vibe? The Commuter Rail branches out from Boston into smaller cities and also great places like Crane Beach (Ipswich) and Back Beach (Rockport). Check them out when it's warm and have fun exploring!\u000aI also have two extra Charlie Cards and if you're a freshman and don't have one yet, let me know! Props to you for actually reading blog posts.\u000a-Brandon\u000a*on the T or the bus. No big bucks saving on the Commuter Rail or the ferry.\u000a

aV\u000aGreetings, Candidates! (And Parents, Gappies, Oliners, and other assorted readers! But this post is more geared towards Candies.)\u000aYou're going to do great things.\u000aOne week from yesterday, you'll find out if you've been accepted to Olin. If the way you're feeling is anything like the way I was feeling, this statement both excites and terrifies you. It feels like so much is riding on it. But I've been there, and I can assure you of one thing: life will go on.\u000aNext Wednesday, one of three doors will open for you:\u000a\u000a1. You've been accepted!\u000aYay! Confetti! Lots of excitement. You've been invited to participate in the great, ongoing experiment we call Olin College. You have a great four years to look forward to here.\u000a2. You've been waitlisted.\u000aYou might decide to take a year and do something awesome, try out another school, or do something you've always wanted to do. You have some exciting opportunities ahead!\u000a3. "We regret to inform you that..."\u000aYou'll have the chance to explore somewhere else. It won't be easy, and I'm sorry. But when you look back years from now, this will be a drop in the bucket. This doesn't change how you'll be feeling in the moment. I may seem seem a bit like:\u000aBut I promise that you still have a brilliant future ahead of you, and that whever you end up, you can make it great.\u000aSo my advice to you is, whichever path you end up on, swim ahead full speed. You have one week left until you know about Olin, and the rest of your senior year to enjoy! Make it a blast: Whatever happens, you have quite the adventure ahead.\u000a\u000aSigning off,\u000aMichael, c/o '17\u000a

aV\u000aHave you ever heard of the "Olin Bubble?\u000aThe concept of the Bubble captures some of the quirks of spending so much time on a ~370 student campus:\u000aYou start to know everyone. Even if you don't know them personally, you recognize their face, and you probably know their name.\u000aYour routine becomes seeing the same people and the same parts of our small campus on a daily basis.\u000aIf you aren't careful to keep up with the news, there's a real danger of losing touch with what's happening in the world outside of Olin, which is a scary thing.\u000aWhile there are certainly some really cool things about having such a small campus, as Lauren highlighted in her blog post, there are also some downsides. After a while, the Bubble can start to feel a bit isolating, even suffocating.\u000aThis was how I started to feel during my second semester at Olin. The magic of first semester began to fade with the end of Pass/No Record, and Olin's charm started to wear off a bit. This was due in part to the fact that I hardly ever got off campus. Save for the occasional midnight IHOP run and the one time I took the train to Worcester to visit a friend, I pretty much didn't leave.\u000aThings changed when I brought my car to campus sophomore year. I was able to get out and explore the surrounding towns whenever I wanted! I could also drive myself to the T to get into Boston. My world was opening up and the effects of the Bubble were lessening. I realized that, while I loved Olin dearly, it was important for my well-being to shake things up once in a while. The important thing here isnt the car, but the revelation it inspired. While it might offer more autonomy, you dont need a car to get off campus. We have Go Bikes so people can ride into Needham, Wellesley, or wherever. We have the HelpMe and Carpe email lists so people can send emails asking for rides and advertising trips off campus. And we have legs! There are definitely a few things within walking distance of Olin, though exactly how many will depend on your definition of "walking distance."\u000aWhat I hadn't anticipated, however, was finding something new and intriguing right here on campus halfway through my junior year. At this year's SERV auction, I won an item called "Exploration of the Great B-yond." This was an item that was being passed down by the previous winners, fellow OLINsider bloggers Michael Sheets and Anne LoVerso. Essentially, it was a guided tour of Parcel B (the woods behind the dorms) that would highlight a variety of strange and intriguing sights. Having lived in said dorm buildings for 2.5 years and having journeyed through Parcel B on various occasions, I wondered how many things could possibly be hidden there that I didn't know about. As it turned out, there were a lot. While I can't divulge all the mysteries of Parcel B, I will say that we saw the remains of three rusty old cars, and I still have no idea how they got there -- they were in some pretty dense pockets of forest!\u000aThe moral of this story is that too much of the same thing is never good, no matter how wonderful that thing might be. While I think we can all agree that there are a lot of incredible things about Olin, it's important to remember that it's not perfect, and the Bubble is a great example of that. With some creativity and initiative, however, the Bubble is nothing to fear! Where theres a will to get off campus, theres a way. And who knows-- you might even find something new and exciting right here on campus when you least expect it.\u000a

aV\u000aAnother packed week. I was running on all burners to get enough done to leave Olin at 6am today. I fled to catch a flight down here to Durham, N.C. for the National Academy of Engineering summit on the Grand Challenges in engineering. The two big last hurdles to leap for the departure were 1) interviewing Candidates and 2) finishing the poster that I'll be presenting tomorrow in the student poster competition.\u000aBetween the two of them, these two worthy activities left me about 3 hours to sleep before hopping the shuttle to Logan airport this morning. It was my first experience interviewing Candidates at Candidates' Weekend, and it was wild. I think I got pretty lucky with the group I interviewed, because it was a real pleasure getting to know these few would-be Oliners. It blew my mind how rich the experience is to observe, and how desperately one must try to soak up as much of a person as possible in this brief time to discover their fit with Olin's people and values. I left it wanting to ask more, wanting to get deeper into these people. I found it difficult to talk with other Candidates in more casual settings without asking searching questions about their hopes and dreams and character. It felt like a significant act to participate in, this unusual admissions process, which would quickly become clumsy if its scale grew (or its yield shrank) much beyond its current size. I was a little apprehensive about my interview team, where I was joined by two staff members from the finance department. It turned out that my two interviewing colleagues immediately reassured me that when it came down to fit with the student body and the particulars of the intense Olin student experience, I was the one best equipped to judge the connection. We worked well together in our difficult task of evaluation. Best of luck to all the Candidates and I hope you find the clarity to see where you fit.\u000aAs for this conference, I'm gradually slipping into the vibe of meeting, greeting, and discussing in quick succession. There are 23 Olin students present, a great showing for a small but feisty school joining in to a meeting of a prestigious, nationally recognized group. We did help organize it, though (mad props to Jaime '12 who kept us all organized and moving through our travel today.)\u000aToday I took a tour of the Duke Smart Home, a sort of live-in lab experiment combining elements of home automation and sustainable technology. Hopefully as it rolls along they'll get deeper into the latter component than purchasing the top end, high efficient appliance X for each task X. But the place is on top of its game enough to be LEED Platinum certified, so they've done a good quantity of work, at least. The program itself has some pretty rockin' student-driven and project focused elements. Check out its page here.\u000aOf the 400 students supposedly registered for this summit, a lot of them must be from the host school, Duke, since we saw maybe a fourth of that today at the Student Day activities. Tomorrow, the program will go over the Grand Challenges for the future with regards to Energy/Environment, Health, and how entrepreneurship will play a role in solving them. The next day we'll hear about the Challenges in Security and Learning/Computation. I've already met some pretty interesting students and faculty, working my way towards the people with the most aligned interest and imagination along the lines of environmental sustainability. Check out what the summit is all about here . More updates tomorrow- lots of sleep to catch up on now.\u000aBennett\u000a

aV\u000aHello friends,\u000aAs you may or may not know from my last post, there's now a rather large ball pit in my room. As you may or may not also know from my roommate's last post, Anne is currently on LOA (leave of absence) in Brazil. Allow me to summarize the implications of these two facts:\u000aAnne got to spend less than a month with the ball pit before she left :(\u000aI now live in a double all by myself\u000aI now have a ball pit all to myself\u000aLife works in mysterious ways, friends.\u000aIn other news, this is my first year having a car on campus. In fact, it's my first year having a car at all. While I may be used to all this snow, having grown up in Massachusetts, I can't say that I was truly prepared for what it would mean for me as a car owner. Digging out my car every time there is a significant snowfall is proving to be huge pain in the neck. Did I mention my roommate was in Brazil? Where, according to the weather app on my phone, is it now 72F? And the high today was 82F? Don't get me wrong, I love living here... it can just stop snowing now. Please. The bottoms of my pants literally froze today.\u000aI'd also like to take this opportunity to tell you all about the coolest project I've worked on at Olin thus far. I present to you, Wizard's Chess!\u000a\u000aThe Knights of the Electromagnetic Table:Raagini,Toni, me,Michael, and Tatiana\u000aHeavily inspired by the game from the Harry Potter universe, it's a voice-controlled chess board with "enchanted" pieces that enforces the rules of chess and gives users verbal feedback. How does it work, you ask? Magic, clearly. But if you aren't convinced, you can check out the project in more detail on my team's website. And, if you want to see it in action, we've been invited to demo it at the Wellesley STEM Expo on March 28th! We'll be working on revamping it up until then, and perhaps beyond. This is by far my favorite example of how "work" at Olin can actually be a ton of fun, and I'm really proud of my team for what we accomplished.\u000a-Haley '17\u000aP.S. Congrats to all the Candidates! Can't wait to meet you soon!\u000aP.P.S. Obligatory "Yay Patriots!" even though I actually cared way more about the Kitten Bowl than the Super Bowl...\u000a

aV\u000a        Summer 2010! Woohoo, we are roughly 2/3 of the way through the hottest months of the year. \u000aHi, I am Aiswarya, one of the youngins' to the Olinsider. And I am officially done with freshman year of Olin; its crazy how fast time flew by - I still remember Orientation week last August. And here I am, with one year of college already down.\u000aFor those of you freshmen that are coming into Olin, I advise you to take the rest of this time to relax with family (near and far) and your High School friends. It is always well-worth it to bid farewell after an awesome summer together. And for those of us that are at Olin for the summer, we are working our jobs, cooking our meals, and relaxing on the weekends (i.e., doing fun things). (Mind you, the cooking part has been the challenging task. The best so far has been baking a Red Velvet Cake for Sam's ('13) birthday. Yummy.)\u000aFor the first few weeks of the summer, I went home to India to see my family. Some of my High School classmates were back too, so I got to spend time with them. It was nice being home, but the weather was so humid, I could literally feel the water droplets in the air! Here are some snapshots from my last visit home.(Clockwise): 1. A lady selling clay pots, ...and taking a break; 2. The Indian roadside; 3. Refreshing coconut water, anyone?; 4. Culture meets technology\u000aAt the start of June, I got back to Olin for research. I am working with fellow Olin '13-er, Erica, and Assistant Professor of Psychology, Jonathan Adler Ph.D, to study Borderline Personality Disorder. We are at the start of week 9, nearing the end of our 10 week program. Our goal this summer is to study Borderline patients from their perspective, their narration of their own life story, and to dissect further symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder from their stream of thought. It has been exciting work analyzing various people's life stories- their experiences, their feelings, their turning points, their dreams.\u000aApart from work, weekends have been the days of adventuring fun. A few weekends ago, the rising-sophomore girls decided to take a mini-road trip to the beaches of Rhode Island. We pulled up to Second Beach in Newport, RI and spent time in the glorious sun and sand. \u000aAbove: Making our way onto the beach\u000aFor the 4th of July, Alison('13), Sam ('13), and I went to New York City (specifically to Long Island) where we met up with Rachel ('13) and spent the long weekend with her family. We had a wonderful time. The 4th included: the day at the Long Island beach, the evening at the grill, and the night at the fireplace for 'smores & fireworks. I was delighted to experience a traditional 4th of July for the first time in my life.\u000aLeft: A view of the Original Macy's & New York traffic; Right: A walk through Central Park\u000aSix flags is on the cards for the coming weeks, as is the end of research. As everything starts to wrap up, I'm looking forward to fitting a few more fun outings into my holidays.\u000aWell, my lunch break is coming to an end and I am heading into Boston for the rest of the day. I look forward to seeing you in September, Olin 2014! Until then, Happy Summer!\u000a\u000aAiswarya KolisettyOlin 2013\u000a\u000a\u000a

p2392
aVThe bucket says it all.
p2393
aVI hardly knew what to expect when my Sibb family (every freshman is paired with an upperclassman, or Sibb, who helps him or her get used to Olin and perhaps even meet other upperclassmen) announced plans for a trip to the local Ben & Jerry's shop; I didn't even know of their existence and still cannot understand why such a place has been kept from me for all my life. I soon learned that not only were we going to consume this formerly rare commodity, we were going to consume an unreasonable quantity.
p2394
aVWithin my first few days at Olin I heard of the legendary Vermonster. Just one week later, I sat in a booth with the rest of my Sibb family, staring down a bucket of ice cream. I kid you not - a bucket.
p2395
aVThe family, pre-consumption
p2396
aVAfter a brief lesson in proper Vermonster consumption, an assortment of frenzied spoons attacked the beast, layer by layer. Family dynamics were particularly prevalent when a choice flavor was uncovered. Proper strategy seemed to dictate that the discovery was to be kept secret to ensure peaceful enjoyment, but when such betrayal was revealed, the offending party suffered a torrent of admonishment. Truly, we are a family.
p2397
aVTackling the beast
p2398
aVThe main event of the evening, however, began when only soup remained in the bucket. My Sibb family maintains deeply-rooted traditions, most of which center around food. One such tradition requires the Sibb who has most recently celebrated a birthday to "chug the bucket." Luckily (?) for me, we sat before the monster just a week after I turned nineteen.

aVThe task is far from daunting when viewed from a safe distance, but as soon as I raised the bucket to my lips, I knew there was much more to the story. Let's just say that my family did a less than stellar sifting of chocolate chips and cookie pieces. A bit overwhelming to be sure, but chants of "Chug! Chug! Chug!" continued until the bucket was drained. What else is family for?
p2400
aVAfter a new round of photos to document the victory, we piled into the cars to get back to Olin. Of course, the family tradition continues to the dorms. Unwritten law mandates the donning of the bucket as an improvised hat for the remainder of the evening. Accordingly, I wandered the West Hall lounges, perfectly playing the part of the fool, yet of the few comments I received, most were merely expressions of envy.
p2401
aVAs trivial as the outing seems, it stands as a testament to this school and its community. Already, Olin has become a second home, a place where I am free to be myself - as clich as it may sound - without question. And it all began with ice cream.

aV\u000a        I'm presently sitting in the library as candidates file in from across the nation and around the world. These bright eyes will see, as I saw only one year ago (minus a week - CW2) the sun glinting off of Milas Hall, the snow drizzled over the O. It also appears that they will be greeted, as I was, by our own Kevin (class of 2012)! He and many other energetic students will be bustling the candidates off on tours and towards adventure (in the adventure-hat direction!).The memories of my candidates weekend are crashing over me. I was seeing Olin for the first time! I got to meet the students and see the facilities, to watch the shows and demonstrations! When I think back to my CW, I think of it through the lens of an Oliner, and I have to wonder: How will this year be different?\u000a\u000a        Certainly, with three groups of 90 students each, we'll have even more\u000afun hearing many more of your stories, seeing more clever name tags,\u000aand answering more unique questions.

On the candidate's side of things, that means an extra\u000aweek of keeping mum about the design build challenge (as one of the\u000acoordinators of the activity, I think you'll have trouble containing\u000ayourselves - it's rather exciting). We don't want the secret leaked!\u000aThere are other secrets or surprises that you'll be bursting to tell\u000abut will have to keep a secret for that much longer!\u000aOn the current student side of things, we have an extra week to perfect\u000aour demonstrations, to avoid doing our homework, and to keep our rooms\u000aclean in case anyone visits.\u000aI know that I'm pleased as punch to have this chance to meet 270\u000afantastic candidates - the countdown is over, and the fun is about to\u000abegin!\u000a

aV\u000aAn old high school friend made fun of me the other day for having a bunch of dry "oooh this is what I'm working on now" entries -- thanks Jacqueline :P!

Congratulations to Olin College's second class, woo!\u000aI really like that commencement, both last year and this year, has been not just a seniors-and-families event, but something that a considerable number of students in other classes, as well as all our faculty and staff are excited about -- one of the things I love about having a small, close community. While I'm always excited to see Olin grow and evolve, I hope we never outgrow being able to have a lot of inter-class interaction.\u000aCheck out the commencement website (here) for more details and pictures in the near future, but until then:\u000aConor Frackleton ('08), one of the junior class reps. helps us get an early start on fund raising for senior activities next year.\u000aMe, Robin Maslowski ('07) and Angela Sharer ('09) are excited to see the sun finally come out after the ceremony.

aV\u000aI had friends (Michael '09, Dan '09, & Alex '08) visiting me over break to go skiing.

I did get to spend the first week of school working for my SCOPE sponsor, Autodesk, in San Francisco though, which was an awesome opportunity.\u000aBecause of the concussion, I sleep through most of every day, and don't have much time to write a post about all this though. It's so frustrating "knowing" what I'm usually able to accomplish in a day, and just not being able to do it.

aV\u000aIt's T-2.5 months and counting, and to be even more specific, T-2.33 repeating months, T-10.3 weeks, T-72 days, T-1728 hours, T-6.22*10^6 seconds between now and when you step onto the now almost eleven year old grounds of the school I consider the greatest institution in the world. You will arrive before the upper classfolks, get to know each other, spend long days and sleeping before we arrive and hail you with calls of "Pass no Record"\u000a\u000aPass no Record is a rallying cry of a generation, or rather, of an incoming freshman class. It is an excuse, a safety net, and a challenge rolled into one simple three word phrase. To some, it is a foreign concept. To others, they have heard it spoken by other institutions who deal in measurements called Smoots and are known by a three letter acronym. But to you, it is a way of life, a mandatory rite of passage that each class has gone through and each class beyond yours shall as well. It is my job to inform you of what this means, in a different perspective from what you may have heard before.\u000a\u000a\u000aSee, I am willing to wager that most of you have never simply "passed" a class. You're some of the best and the brightest folks out there, and so it's safe to say that you don't merely "pass", you excell. But excell as you can, the Olin environment is quite different from High School. Heck, any college will be. But what makes Olin so different is the expectation going in is that you will not know everything. This was shocking to me. Most of you are probably the smartest person in the room on a lot of issues. You're the person that your classmates turn to for help after class, you're the one with the best notes, you're the one so well prepared for the test you don't even need to look over your notes. You have answers, and will work. Walking into week one at Olin, I will bet you five bucks you will find something you do not know... yet.\u000a\u000aAnd that is part of the brilliance of Pass No Record. You enter at a level playing field, and are introduced to the Olin world of collaboration and cooperation over competition. You may not know everything, heck, you may feel like you don't know anything! But it's okay, because your first semester is all about learning all the things you don't know, and helping everyone else to learn the things that you know. And you will and are expected to stumble and fall, but you now have a family of over 80 passionate, interesting, and intelligent siblings, and 240 older brothers and sisters who are ready, willing, and able to help you stand yourself up again.\u000a\u000aBut there is another side to Pass No Record, one that is probably hanging in the back of your mind right this very second. And it's one that we must talk about. See, Pass No Record means that you either Pass, or No Record the class. There are no grades to be working for, only turning in your work to as best you can. So, the challenging part of Pass No Record comes here. You must fight your urge to spend hours on your ModSim problems, stop agonizing over your AHS paper, and instead do things. What those things may be could be anything. It could be 4 AM trips to IHOP. It could be staying up all night watching movies in someone's dorm room. It could be joining a project team and spending all night finishing up one stage of the projects. It could even be sleeping. Whatever you find interesting, you have freedom and license to drop your homework and go do it. If you're late, you're late. The only grade that's being threatened is the one thats in your head.\u000a\u000aSo when us sophomores come storming down the stairs and scream Pass No Record, put down your pencil, shut your laptop, and come join us. We're getting ready to do something awesome, and we always need more friends to do it with.\u000a

aV\u000aMy final fall semester at Olin has drawn to a snowy close. In retrospect, I think experience held me aloft in the sprint to the finish. The little details of taking care of yourself pay back like crazy: maintaining some minimum of sleep and getting in regular workouts were the key ones for me. There's never enough time to do as much as one would like, but I've realized I reside squarely in the camp of those who will always have an overflow of things to do. It's sometimes hard to remember that a different pace of life exists outside of Olin, but moving into winter break offers at least a chance to think about it.\u000aHere's a brief recap of my semester projects. Each one merits a post, and I'll hope to reserve some reflection time on each over the upcoming weeks of respite and write as the spirit moves.  This includes the courses of: SCOPE, Product Design and Development (PDD), my Olin Self Study in environmental impact analysis, Systems, and Intellectual Property.\u000a\u000a\u000aSomewhere in Massachusetts, a blizzard meets a Commuter Rail Station.\u000a-Bennett\u000a\u000aSCOPE- For my Senior COnsulting Project in Engineering, I've been working with a team of seniors and a Babson MBA candidate on product development in the field of electronics waste recycling. My apologies for being intentionally vague about the project until I clear a project description with our sponsor for the SCOPE website. The semester wrapped up as SCOPE projects do with a big presentation to our sponsor and the writing of a hefty bound report. (The test of adequate heft is whether or not the net physical presence of the report suggests that its worth the approx. $25K which a sponsor might contribute to that semester's work.) Our team managed to dodge a slew of final exam scheduling conflicts, and 3/5 of the team having some degree of illness, to pitch our final ideas to our sponsor and left them with something substantial to chew on. Now, we wait to see what they liked well enough to have us build for them next semester. All in all, a strong finish with more to come.\u000aPDD-Product Design and Development was an advanced Design course which included a triple threat of Olin, Babson, and RISD students. My team of students from engineering, business, and industrial design turned on the afterburners to finish out the course with a beautiful prototype of our product and complete pitch of how it works/how we got there. My team had surprisingly good chemistry, and the positive feedback from professors, peers, and professionals at our final presentation made our last all nighter worthwhile. Our product is a device which elegantly eliminates the vampire power wasted by electronic devices in their standby mode. This power wasted by devices when they're not even being used accounts for something around 10% of residential electricity, serving next to no purpose at all. Now the team is talking about taking the project forward and seeing where this product could go if we kept our momentum rolling.\u000aOSS- Every Olin student has a requirement that deliberately breaks their usual teamwork study vibe. It's called the Olin Self Study. An upper level student picks any topic they'd like to study more, builds some sort of research project around it, and takes off on 4 credits of independant research. It tends to be most challenging for the need to self-schedule and self-motivate, and it seems that this is largely the point of the exercise. I completed my OSS this semester with a paper about the fastest wayst to analyze the environmental impacts of a making a product. The point of doing this analysis quickly is to know what aspects of your creations cause the most pollution or toxic waste as you are designing them. The sooner designers know how they're product will cause damage to the environment, the more efficiently they can work around it. My OSS, like many, was primarily a triumph of the latter half of the semester, and only overran the closing of the dorms by a day and half before it was finally submitted. My only regret? Not narrowing down my topic sooner and leaving time to explore the fascinating questions which came up in research.\u000aSystems - I also took an upper level Engineering course called Systems this semester. In this course, we pondered the meaning of Systems Engineering, studied systems dynamics modeling, learned about managing "large scale, complex, technologically enabled" projects, and took a rushed attempt at one of our own. The class covered some interesting points of discussion, but the final project came too late in the semester to rally the full devotion of many team members. In the end, I'm glad for the late night bonding of seniors at the end of their collective wits, delirious but in full conscience of how little we were working with to produce a substantial result.\u000aIP- For a 2 credit AHS/E! course I didn't think I would need to take, Intellectual Property for Scientists and Engineers was one of the most practical courses I took this semester. Just having a clue about types of IP, how to go about getting them, and how to devise IP strategy is already starting to be useful in a big way. See "PDD," above, for example.\u000aWith all this work satisfyingly complete, I made for the hills as an epic storm bore down on Boston on the night the dorms closed for winter break.  Olin students being from about everywhere in the U.S. and quite a few places abroad, the havoc being wrought upon the nation's air transportation system was definitely cause for some scrambling here in Needham. Since I needed only drive a few hours north, I thought I had it easy. But it turned out that a 2 hour drive became an 8 hour trip after trying to coordinate pickup with a passing friend who was herself caught in snow and traffic. Now safely back in Maine, I can enjoy the long awaited arrival of real winter in proper style.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMy gear and I sheltered here a while, waiting to hop a very long ride north.\u000a\u000aSomehow, it's reassuring that nature still makes us pause in the winter.\u000aMerry winter-\u000aBennett\u000a

aV\u000aOr: Summer is Ending.\u000aAs of approximately 1.5 hours ago, I am done with my summer internship at IBM. Tomorrow I move into Olin to being R2 training (see you soon, freshmen!). How did things fly by so quickly? I have no idea. Let's have a fun picture recap!\u000a\u000a         It started out pretty boring. I didn't have a job, I was living at home, and most of my friends were not around. To combat the inevitable creep of despair, I baked cookies and went to the movies.\u000a\u000a\u000aI ran away to California eventually, visiting my boyfriend and his family. One of the loudest members of the family is his cockatiel, Dr. Zaius.\u000a\u000a\u000aSoon after, I had a dilemma. It ended well, though- I was employed and living in the city. Other people had also moved into Boston for the summer by this time, and it meant potlucks, poker nights, and more.\u000a\u000a\u000aThis was actually the image we used to advertise the potluck at my house. Here's a real photo:\u000a\u000a\u000aI also spent time (when it wasn't raining) just wandering around taking pictures.\u000a\u000a\u000aOnce in a while, I would do something epic, like Project Best Idea Ever. (I've been too lazy to get the pictures I took with a waterproof throwaway camera developed yet, so here are some fireworks:)\u000a\u000a\u000aOr Foo Fest. I've gone to the last three Foo Fests, this time joined by David ('11) and John ('11). It's basically a block party with art and music going on for a solid 12 hours. We wandered around Providence after, up onto RISD and Brown's campuses. I got excited because, like Maia, I am probably taking the Product Design and Development course, co-taught with RISD and Babson on RISD's campus. I also got excited because, back in the day, RISD was my dream school.\u000a\u000a\u000aI also got down to the South Shore, where my grandparents live. My older brother and I took the commuter boat (part of the T system here) back up to Boston.\u000a\u000a\u000aEventually, summer was swinging to an end. My IBM team had a goodbye lunch for me on Tuesday, and yesterday happened to be the company picnic. Here is George and another intern playing giant chess in the lounge area:\u000a\u000a\u000aIt was mostly outside, though. The location is usually a ski area (or, at least in winter), so we actually got to ride up and down the ski lift, getting an amazing view.\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd now it's today. I am avoiding packing to some degree. Pretty soon I'm going to start my senior year. It's bizarre how fast it went. But maybe not as bizarre as seeing Halloween-themed items in August.\u000a-Jessi\u000a

aV\u000aHey all,\u000aLike all my co-bloggers I'm back after a nice and lazy blog vacation. So here's what I've been up to thus far this summer:\u000a1) Work: I'm doing research with a nuclear engineering professor at MIT working on algorithms for quantum computing. (Yup, I didn't really know what that meant until I looked it up either.) Most of the lab is comprised of grad. students in either nuclear engineering or physics, and both the other undergraduate students that work in my vicinity are physics majors. A lot of the field is totally new to me, but it's pretty interesting, and I'm finally beginning to feel like I'm making progress.\u000a2) Living at home! My family moved to Acton, MA last summer, and I'm living with them and commuting to Cambridge everyday. My father works in the city and does the commute with me too, so it's been some quality father-daughter bonding time ;). Between that and expectations to make the bed everyday, coming back home after three years (to a house I've never lived in) has its challenges, but being around my family, given that I have no idea where I'll be next year, is well worth it. I even got to go bowling with my sister and friends for her 11th birthday last weekend! =D\u000a3) Eating a lot. Most essential part of living at home.\u000a        \u000a4) Hanging out. There's a ton of Olin people living at different places in Boston/ Cambridge, and there's always something going on on weekends, and no dearth of places to crash. It's definitely refreshing to be able to hang out with people and explore the city without the stress of the semester. Makes me wish I lived in the city again this summer though!\u000a5) Thinking about The Future. I know that I want to go on to grad. school in EE after Olin, and have been looking at different places and programs -- kinda overwhelming at this point, everywhere sounds great, how am I supposed to narrow it down? Although, right now, I'm completely obsessed with the National University of Singapore.\u000a6) I just FINALLY got my MA state license a couple weeks ago.\u000a7) After ~3 years of having had my license in this country, I can finally drive on highways!\u000aThat's about it for now, thanks for reading, and hope everyone is having a fun summer!\u000a

aV\u000a*Warning!* May contain minor spoilers about the movie Big Hero 6 and major spoilers about the Olin experience.\u000aGreetings, Olin friends!\u000a\u000aWhen I saw the movie Big Hero 6 last weekend, (shout out to fellow blogger Haley '17 for being a kid at heart!) there were many parts that made another Oliner and I laugh, squee, exchange knowing glances, and jump up and down with excitement. But perhaps none more than the end of Hiro's first visit to OlinSanfransokyo Institute of Technology. After discovering all the amazing projects going on inside (ranging from robotic arms to magnetically-suspended bikes to healthcare improvements), he stands staring at the campus, and says something along the lines of "If I don't go to this nerd school, I'm going to lose my mind. How do I get in?"\u000aSound familiar?\u000a\u000aNot sure I see the difference?\u000aI was saying the exact same thing after my first (few) visit(s) to Olin. But the connections don't end there: thoughout the film, we're reminded of what our goal should be as engineers: to help people. Tadashi, Hiro's brother, is proud of his healthcare robot Baymax because he knows it's "going to help so many people!", and many of us at Olin are working to be sure we can look at what we've done and say the exact same thing. As I head home for Thanksgiving break it'll be great to have a few days off, but being away always makes me even more excited to get back to what I do.\u000aTo my Olin friends: see you in a week! To my family: great to see you again! To Prospies (prospective students): wishing you the best as you start (thinking about) your essays! To Olin: I'm glad I have a couple more years before I say "I'm satisfied with my care."\u000aUntil we meet again!\u000aMichael '17\u000a(P.S.: Shout out to Grand Challenge Scholars' Program!

aV\u000aGreetings, Olin community & friends!\u000aI write to you from the trenches of finals week, with papers, posters, and presentations coming down at me on all sides. (Actually though: two papers, two posters, and three presentations, but not a single exam. And all for projects I'm really excited about, I might add.)\u000aAnd what else would be moreappropriateto do during all of this than reflect a bit on what they all have in common: a Tissue Engineering project where we created "skin" from (bovine) bone marrow, a Materials Science project analyzing bone strength, a User-Oriented Collaborative Design Project prototyping a private "pop-up" space, and a Foundations of Psychology project researching how we perceive our own health? Besides giving away thatI'm a Bio:E?\u000a\u000aAs much as I wish we were making a TARDIS...\u000aHonestly, I've seen lots of connectionsthroughoutthe semester, however, one of the biggest skills these have all helped me develop (sometimes without even realizing it) has been being able to clearly convey ideas, designs, and findings to others. Project-based learning, and especially this project heavy semester for me, has really driven home the idea that no matter how great your idea is, how perfectly-tailored your design, or how jaw-dropping the results of your research are, if you can't let other people know that in a way that is convincing and compelling, it's not likely you'll make it very far with it. Which is likely something anyone who's been in the field for a while could tell you, but I know isn't something I would have really understood from just cramming for exams.\u000aSo basically, half plug for project-based learning in general, and half plug for how cool the projects we get to do here at Olin are. :) I hope you've enjoyed hearing about a sliver of the amazing things that are happening here!\u000aAnd finally, a hugecongratulationsto Olin's Class of 2019! I might be a liiiitle biased, but I have a feeling you made the right choice. Looking forward to meeting you all this fall!\u000aBest,\u000aMichael c/o '17\u000a

Seeing myself and my classmates wearing these has been a moment to reflect on just how close we are to graduating and what that means. In just a few months, Olin will no longer be my full-time job. Next year, we may be the alumni coming to represent our new employers at career fair. Soon, we'll leave the day-to-day responsibility for shaping Olin as students to the younger classes (can't wait to see where they go with it!) and begin figuring out where and how we can help as alumni. \u000aBut that is still in the future, even though it seems to be rapidly approaching.

aVFirst of all, let me apologize for my sporadic blogging.  It's extremely easy to say "oh, this is a great project! I'll talk about it in my blog!" and then forget to blog for awhile.  So one thing I've been meaning to talk about this semester is my Software Design course.  I think the course is great because it's the perfect blend of instruction, self-teaching, implementation, and projects.
p2438
aVIt also has one of my favorite tools thus far, that I get to experience four times per week- one hour lectures.  Both my Software Design class and my Circuits class have one hour lectures.  These times are nice because it's really easy to tune in and focus for an hour, and it's enough information that you can keep it in your head without forgetting half of it.
p2439
aVSo the point we're at right now is the transition between the learning phase with lectures, homework, and labs, and then the large project that we're starting.  The homework was a lot of fun because it ranged from things like moving turtles around a drawing canvas to create letters and pictures in various ways, analyze words and letters building up to a Markov generator, and programming a Monte Carlo simulation.
p2440
aVNow we're moving into the project phase.  I'll be working with blogger Jeff Moore ('10) and Nick Hobbs ('11) to develop something that Jeff and I have been talking about for over a year, without enough time to do it.  We're going to be building an inventory tracking system for the student government, CORe.
p2441
aVOur overall goal for the system is to be able to give an object a barcode, read in that barcode so items can be checked out to a specific student using a mag strip reader and our student ID cards, and then keep a complete database of all of the items that CORe owns so people can find out what they are, and where they are, to keep people from buying duplicate items, or renting things that we already own. I'm excited for making something so tangible for a class, particularly since I know exactly how it will be applied.

aV\u000aHey everyone! This is my first blog post so I'll start by briefly introducing myself.\u000aI'm Derek Redfern, one of about 20 students who have chosen to defer to the Olin Class of 2015. Currently, I'm traveling around Europe with David '15, one of my future classmates. The posts I make on the student blog will be less about student life and more about my year between high school and college. (Check out myAbout Me page!)\u000aMy first post will tackle the basics of a gap year. Mainly: Why defer?\u000aI never chose to take a year off. It just...grew on me. Let me explain.\u000a\u000aI grew up used to a fast pace of life in a small town in Connecticut. In New England, you know exactly what's expected of you: you try your hardest in school, perform well in sports, join extracurriculars, take up leadership positions, and basically do everything required to get you into a good school. I've heard it's the same to varying degrees in other parts of America as well. But New England is notorious for these expectations placed on students. I certainly conformed to many of them, and so taking a year off never even crossed my mind. It's just not something that's done. People either go straight to college, join the Armed Forces, or find a job.\u000aI was accepted to one of the Candidate's Weekends at Olin but got waitlisted after that. The bad news came in: the Class of 2014 couldn't accept any students on the waitlist. At the time, it seemed like the end of the world for me. Sure, I had other options - I could attend Harvey Mudd or WPI - but I wanted to go to Olin more than any other school.\u000aMy only remaining option was to defer. It was a terribly hard decision for me, since I could only see the negatives. (I'm not usually this pessimistic.) I'd be the only person from my town taking a year off. I would be a year behind my friends in school, and I wouldn't get to go to college until the following year. I had some idea of what I would do during that year, but what if it fell through? Would I be working 9-5 at a retail store for the whole year? There were too many questions and not enough answers.\u000aEventually, I decided to take a chance and choose deferral. Sometimes, the hardest - and least popular - option is the best one, as I've been finding out. I already know that I absolutely made the right choice. As I progress into my gap year, I've been seeing more of the positives and much, much less of the negatives.\u000aHere are some benefits of taking a gap year:\u000a- High school drains you with the stressful workload and aforementioned fast pace of life. A break between high school and college can do you wonders.\u000a- Did you know that in England, it's more uncommon for a student to not take a gap year? Parents encourage their kids to take time off and see a bit of the world before they go to "Uni".\u000a- Sure, your friends will be a year ahead of you in school (I've been hearing from mine about their lives at college) but so what? You'll get there eventually. And you'll be having adventures of your own.\u000a- Depending on how you choose to spend your year, you'll likely arrive at college with significantly more real-world experience than your peers. Who else can say they've attended a party deep within the catacombs under Paris? (I have.)\u000a- You'll be able to do things you'd never have a chance to do otherwise. Travel Europe. Hike from Georgia up to Maine on the Appalachian Trail. Learn to speak fluent Hungarian. Everyone has a dream - take a year to follow yours.\u000a- A gap year is a chance to see the world. You can broaden your horizons immensely, which is a particularly useful trait for an engineer. One of the more practical aspects is that you'll be able to see what people have a need for in other parts of the globe.\u000a- It's just plain fun. While this may not be useful in convincing one's parents, I've been having a blast so far.\u000a- If you want more evidence that taking a gap year is a good idea, check out my personal blog that I cowrite with David '15 about our adventures in Europe. http://eurotripattackofthenerds.blogspot.com\u000aAt some point, prospective students may stumble upon this post. If you're one of them, I have some advice for you: \u000aI recommend a gap year to anyone willing to make that leap of faith, even though the concept is not popular in America. Deferring takes a lot of planning and firm intentions (which will be covered in subsequent posts) but most of all, you have to be willing to go against the grain. The choice is yours - but I assure you that the opportunity is a worthwhile one.\u000aFeel free to comment or email me (redfern.derek at gmail.com) with any questions!\u000aI'll end this post with a favorite quote of mine. Just something to think about.\u000a< Derek >\u000aTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I -I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.~ Robert Frost\u000a

aV\u000aIt's the weekend! Not just any weekend, but a 3-day weekend with beautiful weather forecast and hardly any work to get done. I consider it the universe's belated birthday present to me, although I did have an excellent birthday on Tuesday. Yes, there were meetings to be had and work to be done, but my friends made it a brilliant day nonetheless. Start with free coffee and a book:\u000a\u000aAnd end with some cheese, bread, and other non-pictured refreshments:\u000a\u000aBut this weekend isn't just an extended birthday celebration, it's a much-needed break from the past couple of weeks and a chance to prepare for the final push to the end of classes...\u000aMy calendar tells me there are only 18 days left until the end of classes. That's scary. Partially because it means there are only a handful of weeks before I finish being a sophomore and become a junior. Mostly because there is still so much to do: third Stuff of History project, third phase of UOCD, assorted German studying, and finishing up DICEIO's model of Olin. And of course, it's all terribly fascinating.\u000a\u000aStuff of History just finished up its second project. My team studied (and made!) copper sheathing and investigated whether or not Paul Revere's process for rolling copper was in fact "the best". As part of the project we made some improvement to a Wikipedia article, so feel free to learn more there. We also got to play with copper bolts made by another team and almost exactly replicate what it would have been like to try and attach the copper sheets to the side of a ship. Definitely not your average history class. Or MatSci class, for that matter.\u000a\u000a\u000aCopper spike through a copper sheet that was initially hot-rolled, but finished with a pass of cold-rolling.\u000a\u000aWe survived the second UOCD Design Review comparatively unscathed. This final phase is where we develop our final idea to the point where we could make a detailed product proposal. If we can pull this phase together, it will confirm to our professors that even though our team was not leading the pack for the first two phases, we still learned a lot. Still a daunting task though, especially since our idea is rooted simply in the concept of "telepathy".\u000a\u000aDICIEO continues to fascinate me and drive my interests more and more towards education theory. We now have a very rough mapping of how Olin's goals, values, and methods all relate to each other, based on interviews with faculty, students, and our own insights. Soon we will be talking with alumni and employers to get some post-Olin perspective, but then it will be up to us to put it all together. Our plan is to have something to present at Expo (May 14!) in addition to perhaps writing an open letter to Rick Miller and Vin Manno,addressingconcerns or questions in their proposed vision statement based off of the work we've done this semester.\u000a\u000aDICEIO also excites me because it will be a fully-fledged, 4-credit class next semester. Technically it's called "Representing Olin" or something, but acronyms are so much cooler. We're going to have more people, more space, and more involvement with the community, working on a project I don't think many college students could ever hope to work on. Getting the chance to take all the different parts of a school and distill it down into a clear mapping that says "this is who we are, this is what we want to do, and this is how we do it" is just incredible. And then there's the fact that next semester I will be taking a class I helped write the course description for. Welcome to Olin.\u000a\u000a\u000aSticky notes, moleskines, and coffee: the essential ingredients for a design meeting\u000a\u000aSpeaking of courses, course registration went remarkably smoothly. I'm going to attribute this to how obscenely loud my roommate played "Flight of the Valkyries". It suits theoccasionoh so well. Anyway, I am now registered in Human Factors & Interface Design (HFID - a.k.a. "that class that teaches a lot of what my major is"....well, as soon as I actually fill in the paperwork for Engineering with Design), Real Products Real Markets, Representing Olin, and the Historical & Scientific Approach to Energy & the Environment, a.k.a that class that is in desperate need of a cool acronym. Cool name or not, it should be a cool class. If I've learned anything in Stuff of History this year, it's that any class taught by Rob Martello or Jon Stolk is worth taking.\u000a\u000a\u000aIt's Jon Stolk in a wig. What more can I say.\u000a\u000a

aV\u000a        Hello from the north of England!\u000aI'm one of twelve or so members of the class of 2013 not currently hitting the books in Needham; some are studying away, some have taken a leave of absence to work or travel. I chose to study away at the University of Leeds this semester, looking for a bit of a change from engineering classes, suburb life, and the cushy set-up we have at Olin. To be perfectly blunt, I needed a break from Olin. I love it, and wouldn't choose any other school, but I knew that I needed some time away if I was to fully appreciate it again.\u000aMy international experience before this trip consisted of approximately eight hours in Canada last February. Needless to say, I was nervous, but excited to get going!\u000a        I arrived here a couple weeks ago for orientation-type things, and started classes yesterday. Very different from Olin so far. More on that once I'm actually into the classes.\u000aHere's one photo of a former church at the end of my street.There is a plethora of gorgeous buildings and streets around the city, but I only got my camera battery sorted out today, so more photos will have to wait for later.\u000aAlready, I've managed to set up trips to Stratford-upon-Avon, Edinburgh, and Liverpool, spent some time in Amsterdam during my layover, and attended a Leeds United - Manchester United soccer (whoops, football) game. Must embrace UK life while here!\u000aOne great thing about this experience is that it's part of our limited,\u000abut growing direct exchange program. That means that the university was\u000aalready declared legitimate by the Olin powers that be and my scholarship\u000atransferred. This made life so much easier when applying, which is,\u000alet's face it, rather important to a lazy procrastinator like me. I\u000aencourage anybody considering study away to explore some of the simpler\u000aoptions a bit before discounting them.\u000aI hope to keep this blog filled with stories of fun and adventures this\u000asemester! However, I won't be posting here nearly as often as I will be/have been on my\u000ashiny new personal blog. For that matter, you should check out the Olin Away blog, where most students currently away write about their experiences. There's even a map with a marker for each of us!\u000aSee ya later, Olin. Stay cool. I'll be back.\u000a

aV\u000a        Orlando, Florida was our destination. Last week, 24 women and 2 (manly) men got to Orlando for the annual Society of Women Engineers (SWE) National Conference. As the name suggests, it was a congregation of thousands of women in engineering around the country seeking to network and build career ties with one another.26 students of the Olin chapter accepted the invitation to the conference, of whom 8 were finalists at the Poster Competition. To say the least, we were all eager to meet new people and potential employers outside of the Olin bubble.\u000aAs a participant in the conference, I looked forward: to meet other women in engineering - to learn of their careers, their current work, and their purpose at the conference; to develop my networking and career-seeking skills; to spread the name of Olin; and finally, to enjoy Florida! (I tried really hard to make it to Universal Studios, I really did. Some of the other girls went to Disney World though.)\u000aSneak Preview (with pictures, courtesy of Poorva ('12) and Matt ('12) =):\u000aClockwise\u000a from Top-Left: Part of the Olin SWE Section posing with SWE President\u000aSiddika Demir & our awards; 2. Banquet Hall for Celebrate SWE!;\u000a3. Dinner with Olin Alumna; 4. Tara ('13) and I just before the\u000aCareer Fair\u000aConference Day 1: It consisted of professionals mentoring collegiates in the categories of elevator pitching, self-marketing, and success in the professional field. My elevator pitch required quite some refining, it appeared. An elevator pitch gives me one minute or less to approach a prospective employer, lets say at the career fair later that day, to present my skills and experience to show them why they should work with me. The key was to be concise and powerful, and more importantly, to tell a story that they would remember.\u000aThis opening of the career fair reminded me of a carnival. Literally, there were spinning banners, flashing lights, and enthusiastic hiring recruiters waiting for some talent. Over 300 companies set up shop in the largest hall of the convention center. The automotive companies brought their cars, the hardware companies - their gadgets, and the defense companies - well, their confidentiality. And not to mention, all of those free goodies. Fuzzy blankets, hair mousse, flip flops, notebooks, and post-its, and pens, and pins, and any other stationary memorabilia you could think of. Apart from the cool free stuff, those of us collegians who knew how to pitch our experience and to pick our companies, certainly had a field day at the biggest career fair I've ever seen.\u000aRebecca ('12) at the career fair...(Rebecca, I had to =)\u000a\u000aIt was a pleasant learning experience to meet recruiters at the career fair. Many never heard of the small 300-student school called Olin and it felt good to know that each of the 26 of us at the fair took pride in pitching the school we are building every day. And of course, it took many by surprise. A tiny engineering school in Needham develops impressive experience in its students within just a year of entering college. The recruiters wish they had known sooner (I got this response at one point). I enjoy seeing their response when they learn about the applied project-based work that we built from day one. I am confident we established built-to-last relationships with some of the companies there.\u000aFinally, Celebrate SWE! concluded the three day conference. It was a celebration of 60 years of the Society, a celebration of women who have accomplished as engineers, and a celebration of collegiate sections which have encouraged engineering within their communities and amongst younger generations of girls. The entertainment was nice, the food was delicious, and the mention of Olin was without fail.\u000aOther highlights of the conference include: meeting some of the Olin alumna and chatting with them over dinner about their Olin careers and present lives, walking around Orlando and shopping & eating, and spending that time reflecting on my future as a woman engineer. I enjoyed the experience and the people and look forward to Chicago next year!\u000a\u000a\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aMy journey to being an Olin senior is uncanny to say the least. Growing up in India, where engineering education is limited and constrained to hard science, my views on engineering were skewed. Knowing that something was missing, I searched for a better place to have a higher education than the traditional Indian engineering institutions. My search led me to take a plethora of college courses over the summer at many American universities including Stanford, Harvard, Johns Hopkins to name a few. As my knowledge of american education and culture grew, a little birdie mentioned Olin to me. I looked at the website and some videos on youtube and got a bit excited. To my disdain, I never had a chance to visit it. Then began the application process for colleges and I applied to many places in the states, including Olin. I was waitlisted for Candidates weekend. I didn't really know much about Olin at the time to take it as a serious option, and ended up going to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). \u000a\u000aUIUC and Olin have been partners for quite some time. When I was accepted there as a freshman, I got involved into this program called the Illinois Foundry for Innovation in Engineering Education (iFoundry). It was charged with an olinesque mission to reform the century old engineering curriculum. I was stoked to be a part of this mission and agreed to become the first set of student guinea pigs. I learnt more about engineering education and participated in making UIUC more olin like. We offered Olin courses at UIUC to see how they would/could work. Olin's pride and joy, User Oriented Collaborative Design, which is a heavy design course taken during sophomore year at Olin, caught iFoundry's attention. UOCD approaches solving problems from a user's perspective. It completely flips the way engineering education is approached at UIUC where users are never in question while building something. We literally copy pasted the course, skyped in with Olin faculty during every class session and conducted a remote UOCD experience at UIUC. Me along with 3 other brave souls were along for the ride. This planted a seed in me and I finally fell in love with Olin. \u000a\u000aSince the day I took UOCD, I knew I needed to come to Olin. iFoundry was already planning with Olin to create a student exchange program and I was super excited to be a part of it. I came to Olin in 2011 and ended up staying for a year. I knew I needed to stay longer and thanks to Olin's awesome faculty and staff I was able to do so. And now, 2 years later, I'm finally and Olin senior.\u000a\u000aDuring my exchange year at Olin, I instantly noticed a drastic change in me. I was working on projects not just problem sets. I was creating things of value not just talking theory. I was hustling and get stuff done and not just planning and talking about stuff. I was working harder and loved every second of it. I soon realized what excited me about engineering. Why I had no problems staying till 4 am working on a project? It was because in the midst of frustration when everything is against you, when you can barely think straight and the light at the end of the tunnel is completely dim, when you have tried and failed and tried again and failed and tried again and failed again, when your fingers hurt from typing so much code or your pants are completely worn out for the wood debris, when your team has lost all motivation, it suddenly all comes together and works. This is why I'm an engineer. This moment occurrence once and only once in my 2 years at UIUC. I came to Olin to chase this moment almost like an addict. During my year at Olin as an exchange student, I had such a moment every 2 weeks if not more often. By the end of my fall semester at Olin, I knew I wanted more and stayed for the Spring, and by end of spring, I knew this was it and I had to transfer. \u000a\u000aI chose Olin because it made me happy. I chose Olin to chase the joy of learning.\u000a\u000a
